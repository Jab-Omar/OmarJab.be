## More About Static NAT

- **Static NAT** involves configuring fixed one-to-one mappings between private IP addresses and public IP addresses. 
- When traffic from an internal host is sent to an external network, the router translates the source address.

- This mapping also allows external hosts to access the internal host using its **inside global address**.

## Dynamic NAT

- In **Dynamic NAT**, the router dynamically maps **inside local addresses** to **inside global addresses** as needed.
- An **Access Control List (ACL)** is used to determine which traffic should be translated:
  - If the source IP is **permitted**, it will be translated.
  - If the source IP is **denied**, it will not be translated.

  ðŸ’¡ Note: Packet traffic will not be dropped if the source IP is denied.

- A **NAT pool** defines the available inside global addresses.

### Key Characteristics of Dynamic NAT

- Despite being dynamically assigned, the mappings remain one-to-one (one inside local IP address per inside global IP address).
- If there are not enough inside global IP addresses available (i.e., all are in use), it is referred to as **NAT Pool Exhaustion**.
  - If a packet from another inside host arrives and requires NAT but no addresses are available, the router will drop the packet.
  - The host will be unable to access outside networks until one of the inside global IP addresses becomes available.
  - Dynamic NAT entries will automatically time out if not used, or they can be cleared manually.

### NAT Pool Exhaustion

In this example, **192.168.0.167** times out and **192.168.0.98** is assigned as its translated source IP.

## Dynamic NAT Configuration

To view NAT translations, use the command:

```
show ip nat translations
```

## Dynamic PAT (NAT Overload)

- **PAT (Port Address Translation)** translates both the IP address and the port number when necessary.
- By using a unique port number for each communication flow, a single public IP address can be shared by many different internal hosts.
  - Since port numbers are 16 bits long, there are over **65,000 available port numbers**.
- The router tracks which inside local address is using which inside global address and port.
