## Review: Hexadecimal

Before diving into IPv6, let's review hexadecimal (hex) and its conversion to binary.

### Hexadecimal to Binary Conversion

Hexadecimal is a base-16 numbering system, using digits 0-9 and letters A-F.

- Each hex digit corresponds to a 4-bit binary number.

Example:

- **Hex `A`** is **Binary `1010`**
- **Hex `F`** is **Binary `1111`**

### Binary to Hexadecimal Conversion

What about converting binary back to hex?

- Group the binary digits into sets of 4 bits (starting from the right).
- Convert each group to its corresponding hex value.

Example:

- **Binary `1010 1100`** becomes **Hex `AC`**

## Why IPv6?

The primary reason for IPv6 is the exhaustion of IPv4 addresses.

- **IPv4 Address Space:** 2^32 addresses (4,294,967,296 total)
- IPv4 was designed over 30 years ago, without anticipating todayâ€™s global internet scale.

To manage the scarcity, techniques like **VLSM, private IPv4 addresses,** and **NAT** have been used, but these are short-term solutions.

#### Long-Term Solution: IPv6

IPv6 provides a much larger address space, with 2^128 possible addresses.

#### IPv4 Exhaustion Timeline

- **September 24, 2015:** ARIN exhausted its IPv4 address pool.
- **August 21, 2020:** LACNIC announced its final IPv4 allocation.

## Basics of IPv6

- **IPv6 Address Length:** 128 bits (16 bytes)

![[31_ipv6Part1_06.png]]

- **Address Notation:** IPv6 uses a hexadecimal notation and a prefix length (e.g., `2001:0db8:85a3::8a2e:0370:7334/64`).

## Shortening (Abbreviating) IPv6 Addresses

IPv6 addresses can be quite long, so they can be abbreviated by:

1. **Removing Leading Zeros:** 
   - `2001:0db8:0000:0042:0000:8a2e:0370:7334` can be shortened to `2001:db8:0:42:0:8a2e:370:7334`.

2. **Using Double Colons (`::`) for Continuous Zeros:**
   - `2001:0db8:0000:0000:0000:0000:1428:57ab` becomes `2001:db8::1428:57ab`.

   **Important:** You can only use `::` once in an address.

## Expanding IPv6 Addresses

To expand an abbreviated IPv6 address, simply reverse the shortening process:

- Replace `::` with the appropriate number of zeros.
- Add back any leading zeros.

## Finding the IPv6 Prefix (Global Unicast Addresses)

When an enterprise requests IPv6 addresses from their ISP, they typically receive a /48 block.

- **Typical Subnet Prefix Length:** /64
- **Subnetting:** The enterprise can use the remaining 16 bits to create subnets, with the last 64 bits used for host addresses.

![[31_ipv6Part1_13.png]]
![[31_ipv6Part1_14.png]]

- **Important:** Remember that you can only remove leading zeros.

Example:

- **Address:** `2001:0DB8:8B00:0001:FB89:017B:0020:0011/93`
  
  - The /93 prefix means we need to convert the last digit to binary and adjust the prefix accordingly.

## Configuring IPv6 Addresses

### Enabling IPv6 Routing on a Router

To enable IPv6 routing:

```plaintext
R1(config)# ipv6 unicast-routing
```

### Configuring an Interface with an IPv6 Address

To configure an IPv6 address on an interface:

```plaintext
R1(config)# int g0/0
R1(config-if)# ipv6 address 2001:db8:0:0::1/64
R1(config-if)# no shutdown
```

- **Note:** You can type out the full address if necessary.

### Link-Local Addresses

- **Link-Local Addresses:** These are automatically generated when configuring an IPv6 address on an interface. More on this in the next lecture.
