## What are ACLs?

Access Control Lists (ACLs) are essential tools in networking, particularly for managing traffic flow and enhancing security. In the context of network security, ACLs serve as **packet filters**, instructing routers on whether to **allow** or **deny** specific traffic based on various criteria.

### Key Characteristics of ACLs:
- ACLs can filter traffic based on:
  - **Source/Destination IP addresses**
  - **Source/Destination Layer 4 ports** (e.g., TCP/UDP ports)
  - Other parameters like protocol types

- Throughout **Day 34** and **Day 35**, the focus will be on ACLs from a **security perspective**.

## How ACLs Work

An ACL consists of an ordered list of **Access Control Entries (ACEs)**. When a packet is evaluated by the router, it is checked against the ACEs one by one, from top to bottom. Once a match is found, the corresponding action (permit or deny) is applied, and no further ACEs are processed.

### Example Requirement:
- Hosts in the `192.168.1.0/24` network **should** have access to the `10.0.1.0/24` network.
- Hosts in the `192.168.2.0/24` network **should not** have access to the `10.0.1.0/24` network.

### Configuring ACLs

ACLs are configured globally on the router in **Global Configuration Mode**. However, defining an ACL does not make it active until it is **applied to an interface**.

Key points:
- ACLs can be applied either **inbound** (before the traffic enters the router) or **outbound** (before the traffic leaves the router).
- When a packet is compared to an ACL, if it matches an ACE, the router performs the action defined (permit or deny) and stops evaluating further entries.

## Implicit Deny

At the end of every ACL, there is an **implicit deny** rule. This means that if a packet does not match any of the ACEs in the list, it will be **automatically denied**.

### Key Takeaway:
- If a packet fails to match any ACE, the implicit deny at the end will reject the traffic.

## ACL Types

ACLs can be categorized into different types. For now, the focus is on **Standard Numbered ACLs** and **Standard Named ACLs**.

*Figure 4: Overview of ACL Types*

### Standard Numbered ACLs

**Standard Numbered ACLs** filter traffic based solely on the **source IP address**. They are identified by a **number**. For example, ACL 1, ACL 2, etc.

#### Key Numbering Ranges:
- Standard ACLs can use numbers from **1-99** and **1300-1999**.

#### Basic Command Syntax:
To configure a Standard Numbered ACL:
```
R1(config)# access-list *number* {deny | permit} *source-IP wildcard-mask*
```

##### Example Configurations:
1. Denying a specific host:
   ```
   R1(config)# access-list 1 deny 1.1.1.1 0.0.0.0
   ```
   This denies traffic from `1.1.1.1`. Alternatively, you can use:
   ```
   R1(config)# access-list 1 deny host 1.1.1.1
   ```

2. Permitting all traffic:
   ```
   R1(config)# access-list 1 permit any
   ```
   or
   ```
   R1(config)# access-list 1 permit 0.0.0.0 255.255.255.255
   ```

3. Adding a remark (comment):
   ```
   R1(config)# access-list 1 remark ## BLOCK BOB FROM ACCOUNTING ##
   ```

### Applying an ACL to an Interface

After configuring an ACL, it must be applied to an interface using the following command:
```
R1(config-if)# ip access-group *number* {in | out}
```

For example, applying the rule on `G0/2` interface **outbound**:
```
R1(config-if)# ip access-group 1 out
```

### Why Apply Standard ACLs Close to the Destination?

**Standard ACLs** should be applied **as close to the destination as possible**. This minimizes unnecessary traffic filtering earlier in the network and allows traffic to be evaluated closer to its final destination.

---

## Standard Named ACLs

**Named ACLs** allow you to assign a descriptive name to the ACL, instead of using a number. This helps in managing and identifying ACLs more effectively.

### Configuration Steps:
1. Enter **Standard Named ACL Configuration Mode**:
   ```
   R1(config)# ip access-list standard *acl-name*
   ```

2. Configure individual entries within that mode:
   ```
   R1(config-std-nacl)# [*entry-number*] {deny | permit} *source-IP wildcard-mask*
   ```

#### Example:
- Denying traffic from a specific host:
   ```
   R1(config-std-nacl)# 10 deny host 1.1.1.1
   ```

- Permitting traffic from any source:
   ```
   R1(config-std-nacl)# 20 permit any
   ```

### Viewing and Reordering ACLs

When viewing an ACLâ€™s configuration, you might notice that the entries may be reordered based on their **sequence numbers**. This happens on some platforms or tools (like Cisco Packet Tracer), which might not reorder the entries automatically.
