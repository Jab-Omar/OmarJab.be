## SWITCHES

**Switches** provide multiple **ports** for connectivity, typically featuring **24 ports**. These ports are generally **RJ-45 (Registered Jack)** ports.

---

## WHAT IS ETHERNET?

**Ethernet** is a collection of network protocols and standards that allow devices to communicate over a network.

### Why Do We Need Network Protocols and Standards?

- They provide common communication standards across networks.
- They establish common hardware standards to enable connectivity between devices.

---

## Connection Speeds

Connections between devices operate at specific speeds, measured in **bits per second (bps)**.

- A **bit** is a value of "0" or "1".
- A **byte** consists of **8 bits**.

| Size             | Number of Bits    |
|------------------|-------------------|
| 1 kilobit (Kb)   | 1,000             |
| 1 megabit (Mb)   | 1,000,000         |
| 1 gigabit (Gb)   | 1,000,000,000     |
| 1 terabit (Tb)   | 1,000,000,000,000 |

## Ethernet Standards

Ethernet standards are defined in the **IEEE 802.3** standard, established in **1983** by the **Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)**.

### ETHERNET STANDARDS (COPPER)

| Speed     | Common Name           | Standard  | Cable Type   | Max Transmission Distance |
|-----------|-----------------------|-----------|--------------|---------------------------|
| 10 Mbps   | Ethernet              | 802.3i    | 10BASE-T     | 100m Max                  |
| 100 Mbps  | Fast Ethernet         | 802.3u    | 100BASE-T    | 100m Max                  |
| 1 Gbps    | Gigabit Ethernet      | 802.3ab   | 1000BASE-T   | 100m Max                  |
| 10 Gbps   | 10 Gigabit Ethernet   | 802.3an   | 10GBASE-T    | 100m Max                  |

- **BASE**: Refers to Baseband Signaling.
- **T**: Indicates Twisted Pair.

Most Ethernet connections use **copper cables**, specifically **Unshielded Twisted Pair (UTP)** cables, which are designed without a metallic shield. The twisting of the wires helps protect against **Electromagnetic Interference (EMI)**.

>[!info] EXAM TIP¬†
>For the purpose of the CCNA exam, there is no need to memorize the IEEE task group names associated with each standard. You should be aware of the¬†_speed-derived_¬†and¬†_informal_¬†names, however.

### Note on Wire Usage

Most Ethernet cables use **8 wires (4 pairs)**. However, **10/100BASE-T** only requires **2 pairs (4 wires)**.

## How Do Devices Communicate?

Each Ethernet cable is equipped with an **RJ-45 plug** featuring **8 pins**.

![RJ-45 Pins](2_InterfacesAndCables_02.png)

### Communication Process

- **PCs Transmit (TX)** data on **Pins #1-2**.
- **Switches Receive (RX)** data on **Pins #1-2**.
- **PCs Receive (RX)** data on **Pins #3-6**.
- **Switches Transmit (TX)** data on **Pins #3-6**.

This setup enables **Full-Duplex** transmission of data, allowing simultaneous sending and receiving.

---

## Connecting Routers and Switches

When connecting a **Router** to a **Switch**:

![Router to Switch Connection](2_InterfacesAndCables_03.png)

- **Routers Transmit (TX)** data on **Pins #1-2**.
- **Routers Receive (RX)** data on **Pins #3-6**.
- **Switches Transmit (TX)** data on **Pins #3-6**.
- **Switches Receive (RX)** data on **Pins #1-2**.

The cable used for this connection is called a **Straight-Through cable**.

---

## Connecting Similar Devices

To connect similar devices, a **Crossover cable** must be used instead of a **Straight-Through cable**. This type of cable swaps the pins on one end to allow a successful connection.

![Crossover Cable](2_InterfacesAndCables_04.png)

### Pin Configuration for Crossover Cable

| Pin #   | Connection  |
|---------|-------------|
| Pin #1  | Pin #3     |
| Pin #2  | Pin #6     |
| Pin #3  | Pin #1     |
| Pin #6  | Pin #2     |

---

### Pin Configuration Overview

| DEVICE TYPE | TRANSMIT (TX) PINS | RECEIVE (RX) PINS |
|-------------|---------------------|--------------------|
| ROUTER      | 1 and 2             | 3 and 6            |
| FIREWALL    | 1 and 2             | 3 and 6            |
| PC          | 1 and 2             | 3 and 6            |
| SWITCH      | 3 and 6             | 1 and 2            |

---

## Auto MDI-X Feature

Most modern equipment now has **AUTO MDI-X**, which automatically detects which pins their neighbor is transmitting on and adjusts the pins for receiving data accordingly.

For standards **1000BASE-T/10GBASE-T**, **4 pairs (8 wires)** are used, and each wire pair is **bidirectional**, allowing for faster data transmission compared to **10/100BASE-T**.

## Fiber-Optic Connections

Fiber-optic connections are defined in the **IEEE 802.3ae** standard.

- The **SFP Transceiver (Small Form-Factor Pluggable)** allows fiber-optic cables to connect to switches and routers.
- Fiber-optic connections have separate cables for transmission and reception.

![Fiber-Optic Parts](2_InterfacesAndCables_06.png)

---

## Types of Fiber-Optic Cables

### Single-Mode Fiber

![Single-Mode Fiber](2_InterfacesAndCables_07.png)

- **Narrower** than multimode.
- Light enters at a single angle (mode) from a **laser-based transmitter**.
- Supports longer distances than both **UTP** and **multimode fiber**.
- More expensive than multimode fiber due to the cost of laser-based SFP transmitters.

### Multimode Fiber

![Multimode Fiber](2_InterfacesAndCables_08.png)

- Core is **wider** than single-mode.
- Allows multiple angles (modes) of light waves to enter the core.
- Supports longer distances than UTP but shorter than single-mode.
- Cheaper than single-mode fiber due to the use of less expensive **LED-based SFP transmitters**.

## Fiber Optic Standards

| Speed       | Standard  | Connection Speed | Mode Support             | Max Transmission Distance        |
|-------------|-----------|------------------|--------------------------|----------------------------------|
| 1000BASE-LX | 802.3z    | 1 Gbps           | Multimode / Single       | 550 meters (Multi) / 5 km (Single) |
| 10GBASE-SR  | 802.3ae   | 10 Gbps          | Multimode                | 400 meters                       |
| 10GBASE-LR  | 802.3ae   | 10 Gbps          | Single                   | 10 kilometers                    |
| 10GBASE-ER  | 802.3ae   | 10 Gbps          | Single                   | 30 kilometers                    |

## UTP vs. Fiber-Optic Cabling

### UTP Advantages and Disadvantages:

- **Cost**: Lower cost than fiber-optic.
- **Distance**: Shorter maximum distance (~100m).
- **Interference**: Vulnerable to EMI (Electromagnetic Interference).
- **Ports**: RJ45 ports used with UTP are cheaper than SFP ports.
- **Security**: Emits a faint signal outside of the cable, which can be intercepted (security risk).

### Fiber-Optic Advantages and Disadvantages:

- **Cost**: Higher cost than UTP.
- **Distance**: Longer maximum distance than UTP.
- **Interference**: Immune to EMI.
- **Ports**: SFP ports are more expensive than RJ45 ports (single-mode is more expensive than multimode).
- **Security**: Does not emit any signal outside of the cable (no security risk).
