## Review: Basic VLAN Topology

Let's start with the basic VLAN topology from Part 1.

## Expanded Network Topology

Now, consider a more complex network topology:

![[17_vlansPart2_02.png]]

In this setup, we have two switches (SW1 and SW2), with the Engineering department (VLAN 10) located at two different network locations.

## Trunk Ports

- In a small network with only a few VLANs, it’s possible to use a separate interface for each VLAN when connecting switches to switches, or switches to routers.
  
- However, as the number of VLANs increases, this method becomes inefficient. It leads to wasted interfaces, and often routers won’t have enough interfaces to support all VLANs.

- **Trunk Ports** solve this problem by allowing multiple VLANs to share a single interface, effectively carrying traffic from multiple VLANs over a single connection.

#### Example: A Trunk Port Carrying Multiple VLAN Connections

## How Does Trunking Work?

When a packet travels over a trunk port, how does it know which VLAN to use? This is managed through **VLAN Tags**.

- **VLAN Tagging:** Switches tag frames with VLAN information when they are sent over a trunk link, allowing the receiving switch to know which VLAN the frame belongs to.

- **Trunk Port:** This port type uses "tagged" frames.

- **Access Port:** This port type uses "untagged" frames.

## VLAN Tagging Protocols

There are two main trunk protocols:

1. **ISL (Inter-Switch Link):** A Cisco proprietary protocol that is now outdated.
2. **IEEE 802.1Q (dot1q):** An industry-standard protocol developed by the IEEE.

ISL is rarely used today, even on Cisco equipment. For the CCNA exam, you need to focus on 802.1Q.

## Ethernet Header with 802.1Q

![[17_vlansPart2_05.png]]

- The **802.1Q Tag** is inserted between the Source MAC and Type/Length fields in the Ethernet frame.
- The tag is 4 bytes (32 bits) long and consists of two main fields:
  1. **Tag Protocol Identifier (TPID):** Identifies the frame as tagged with 802.1Q.
  2. **Tag Control Information (TCI):** Contains three sub-fields:
  
  ![[17_vlansPart2_06.png]]

### TPID (Tag Protocol Identifier)

- 16 bits (2 bytes) long, always set to `0x8100` to indicate 802.1Q tagging.

### TCI (Tag Control Information)

1. **PCP (Priority Code Point):** 
   - 3 bits, used for Class of Service (CoS) to prioritize important traffic.
   
2. **DEI (Drop Eligible Indicator):** 
   - 1 bit, used to mark frames that can be dropped if the network is congested.
   
3. **VID (VLAN ID):** 
   - 12 bits, identifies the VLAN the frame belongs to. 
   - Allows for 4096 VLANs (0-4095), but VLANs 0 and 4095 are reserved, so the usable range is 1-4094.

## VLAN Ranges

Here’s a breakdown of VLAN ranges:

## Native VLAN

The Native VLAN is the default VLAN for untagged traffic on a trunk port.

## Configuring Trunk Ports

### Step-by-Step Trunk Configuration:

1. **Select Interface:**
   - Begin by selecting the interface you wish to configure as a trunk.

2. **Set Trunk Encapsulation:**
   - Use `#switchport trunk encapsulation dot1q` to set the encapsulation to 802.1Q.

3. **Enable Trunk Mode:**
   - Use `#switchport mode trunk` to manually configure the interface as a trunk port.

![[17_vlansPart2_13.png]]

### Verification

- Use the `#show interfaces trunk` command to confirm which interfaces are set as trunk ports.

![[17_vlansPart2_14.png]]

### Allow Specific VLANs on a Trunk

- You can specify which VLANs are allowed to traverse a trunk link.

![[17_vlansPart2_15.png]]
![[17_vlansPart2_16.png]]

### Change the Native VLAN

- The Native VLAN can be modified if needed.

## Setting Up Trunks for This Network

For our example network, we’ll need to configure the following:

- **SW1:** `g0/0` interface (already configured in the previous section).
- **SW2:** `g0/0` and `g0/1` interfaces.

### Configuring SW2 `g0/0`

![[17_vlansPart2_20.png]]

### Configuring SW2 `g0/1`

## What About the Router (R1)?


## Router on a Stick (ROAS)

**Router on a Stick (ROAS)** is a method used to route traffic between multiple VLANs using a single physical interface on a router, leveraging sub-interfaces.

![[17_vlansPart2_22.png]]
![[17_vlansPart2_23.png]]
![[17_vlansPart2_24.png]]

### Sub-Interface Configuration

- Sub-interfaces are named (e.g., `0.10`, `0.20`, `0.30`) according to the VLAN they serve.
- Assign IP addresses to sub-interfaces just like you would with regular interfaces, using the last usable IP address in each VLAN subnet.

- **Show IP Interface Brief:** Sub-interfaces will appear in the output of this command.

![[17_vlansPart2_25.png]]

- **Show IP Route:** Sub-interfaces will also appear in the router’s route table.

## ROAS Functionality

- **Routing Between VLANs:** ROAS allows the router to route between VLANs using a single interface and its associated sub-interfaces.
- **Trunk Configuration:** The switch interface connected to the router is configured as a trunk port.
- **Sub-Interface Behavior:** The router uses VLAN tags to determine which sub-interface to process incoming frames on and tags outgoing frames accordingly.

This method is highly efficient in VLAN routing, particularly in environments where conserving physical interfaces is necessary.
