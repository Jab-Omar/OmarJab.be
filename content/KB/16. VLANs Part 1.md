## What is a LAN?

A **LAN (Local Area Network)** is a single broadcast domain, meaning it includes all devices that can receive broadcasts from any device within that domain.

## Broadcast Domains

A **Broadcast Domain** is a group of devices that will receive a broadcast frame (Destination MAC: `FFFF.FFFF.FFFF`) sent by any member of the group.

### Example: LAN with Four Broadcast Domains (192.168.1.0/24)

## Performance Considerations

Excessive unnecessary broadcast traffic can significantly reduce network performance.

### Broadcast Traffic Impact

Flooding a network with broadcast frames can cause congestion, affecting all connected subnets.

## Security Implications

Even within the same office, itâ€™s essential to control who has access to specific resources. While security policies can be applied on a router or firewall, in a single LAN, PCs can communicate directly without passing through these security devices. As a result, those security policies might not be effective.

## What is a VLAN?

A **VLAN (Virtual Local Area Network)** is a method to logically separate end-hosts at Layer 2.

### Key Features of VLANs:
- **Logical Separation:** VLANs logically separate hosts at Layer 2, independent of their physical location.
- **Configuration on Switches:** VLANs are configured on Layer 2 switches, on a per-interface basis.
- **Interface Assignment:** Any end host connected to an interface that belongs to a VLAN becomes part of that VLAN.

## Purpose of VLANs

### 1. Network Performance
- **Reduction of Unnecessary Broadcasts:** VLANs help reduce unnecessary broadcast traffic, preventing network congestion and improving overall performance.

### 2. Network Security
- **Enhanced Security:** VLANs limit broadcast and unknown unicast traffic, which also improves security by ensuring that messages are not received by devices outside of the VLAN.

## VLAN Traffic Management

Switches **do not** forward traffic directly between hosts in different VLANs. For communication between different VLANs, the traffic must be routed.

### Routing Between VLANs

Traffic between VLANs is routed through a device like a router (R1 in this case).

## Configuring VLANs on Cisco Switches

To view VLAN configurations on a switch, use the `#show vlan brief` command. This command shows which VLANs exist on the switch and which interfaces are assigned to each VLAN.

- **Default VLANs:** VLANs 1 (DEFAULT) and 1002-1005 exist by default and **cannot be deleted**.

## Assigning Interfaces to a VLAN

### Step-by-Step Configuration:

1. **Select Interfaces:**
   - Use the `interface range` command to select multiple interfaces simultaneously.

2. **Set as Access Port:**
   - Use the `switchport mode access` command to configure the interface as an **Access Port**.

### What is an Access Port?

- An **Access Port** is a switch port that belongs to a single VLAN and typically connects to end hosts, like PCs.
- **Trunk Ports:** Switchports that carry traffic for multiple VLANs are called **Trunk Ports** (more on Trunk Ports in the next chapter).

3. **Assign VLAN:**
   - Use the `switchport access vlan <#>` command to assign a VLAN to the selected port.

- **Creating and Naming VLANs:**
   - Use `#vlan <#>` to enter Configuration Mode for a specific VLAN (this also creates the VLAN).
   - Use `#name <name>` to name your VLAN.

- **Verification:**
   - To check your VLAN configuration, use `#show vlan brief`.

## Testing VLAN Configuration

For example, when testing VLAN 10, you can send a ping from PC1 using the broadcast address `255.255.255.255` (`FFFF:FFFF:FFFF`). This will flood broadcast packets to Router R1 and VLAN 10 hosts only, ensuring that the traffic is contained within the VLAN.
