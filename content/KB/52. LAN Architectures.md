In this section, we will explore various **LAN architectures** and **design principles**. You have already studied several network technologies, including **routing**, **switching**, **Spanning Tree Protocol (STP)**, **EtherChannel**, **Open Shortest Path First (OSPF)**, **First Hop Redundancy Protocols (FHRPs)**, and **switch security features**. Now, letâ€™s delve into basic network design and architecture.

### Key Points to Consider in Network Design
- There are standard **best practices** for network design, but few **universal correct answers** exist.
- The answer to many general questions about network design is often "It depends."
- As you start your networking career, you may not be tasked with designing networks yourself. However, understanding the fundamentals of network design is crucial for effective **configuration** and **troubleshooting**.

## Common Terminologies

### Star Topology
- In a **star topology**, multiple devices connect to a single central device, creating a star-like structure.

### Full Mesh Topology
- A **full mesh topology** connects each device to every other device in the network.

### Partial Mesh Topology
- A **partial mesh topology** connects some devices to each other but not all, allowing for more flexibility.

## Two-Tier and Three-Tier LAN Architecture

### Two-Tier LAN Design
- The **two-tier LAN design** consists of two hierarchical layers:
  - **Access Layer:** 
    - This layer connects end hosts (e.g., PCs, printers, cameras).
    - Access layer switches usually have many ports for host connections.
    - **Quality of Service (QoS)** marking is typically performed here.
    - Security services like **Port Security** and **Dynamic ARP Inspection (DAI)** are implemented.
    - Switch ports may be **Power over Ethernet (PoE)** enabled for devices like wireless access points (APs) and IP phones.
  - **Distribution Layer:** 
    - This layer aggregates connections from access layer switches.
    - It serves as the border between Layer 2 and Layer 3.
    - Connects to services such as the internet and WANs.
    - Sometimes referred to as the **aggregation layer**.

### Three-Tier Campus LAN Design
- In large networks with multiple distribution layer switches (e.g., across separate buildings), the number of connections required can grow significantly.

![[52_lanArchitectures_08.png]]

- To **scale** large LAN networks, a **core layer** can be added.
  - **Cisco** recommends implementing a core layer if there are more than three distribution layers in a single location.

#### Three-Tier LAN Design Components:
- **Access Layer**
- **Distribution Layer**
- **Core Layer**

#### Core Layer:
- Connects distribution layers in large LAN networks.
- Focuses on **speed** (referred to as "fast transport").
- Avoids CPU-intensive operations such as security measures and QoS marking at this layer.
- All connections are Layer 3, with **no spanning tree**.
- Maintains connectivity throughout the LAN even if devices fail.

## Spine-Leaf Architecture (Data Center)

- **Cisco ACI Architecture** (Application Centric Infrastructure) employs the spine-leaf architecture.
- Data centers are specialized facilities designed to house computer systems such as servers and network devices.
- Traditional data center designs utilized a three-tier architecture (Access-Distribution-Core), effective when most traffic was **north-south**.

![[52_lanArchitectures_11.png]]

- With the rise of **virtual servers**, applications are often deployed in a distributed manner, increasing **east-west traffic** within data centers.
- The traditional three-tier architecture led to bandwidth bottlenecks and variability in server-to-server latency depending on the traffic path.
- To address these issues, **spine-leaf architecture** (also known as **Clos architecture**) has gained popularity in data centers.

### Rules for Spine-Leaf Architecture
- Every **leaf switch** is connected to every **spine switch**.
- Every **spine switch** connects to every **leaf switch**.
- **Leaf switches** do not connect to one another.
- **Spine switches** do not connect to one another.
- End hosts (e.g., servers) connect only to leaf switches.

![[52_lanArchitectures_12.png]]

- The path taken by traffic is randomly selected to balance the load among spine switches.
- Each server experiences the same number of "hops" (except those connected to the same leaf), ensuring consistent latency for east-west traffic.

## SOHO (Small Office / Home Office)

- **Small Office / Home Office (SOHO)** refers to a small company's office or a compact home office with limited devices.
  - It does not have to be a formal home office; any home network connected to the internet qualifies as a SOHO network.

- SOHO networks typically have simple requirements, often fulfilled by a **single device**, commonly called a **home router** or **wireless router**.
- This single device can serve multiple functions, including:
  - **Router**
  - **Switch**
  - **Firewall**
  - **Wireless Access Point**
  - **Modem**
