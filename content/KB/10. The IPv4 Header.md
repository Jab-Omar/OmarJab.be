## Overview

The **Internet Protocol Version 4 (IPv4) Header** is a crucial part of Layer 3 in the OSI model, used to route data across different networks, including vast distances over the internet. This header encapsulates a TCP or UDP segment, aiding in the process known as **routing**.

## Fields of the IPv4 Header

The IPv4 header contains several fields, each with a specific role in ensuring the proper delivery and processing of packets.

| **Field**             | **# of Bits** |
|-----------------------|---------------|
| **VERSION**           | 4             |
| **IHL**               | 4             |
| **DSCP**              | 6             |
| **ECN**               | 2             |

| **IDENTIFICATION**    | 16            |
| **FLAGS**             | 3             |
| **FRAGMENT OFFSET**   | 13            |

| **HEADER CHECKSUM**   | 16            |
| **SOURCE ADDRESS**    | 32            |
| **DESTINATION ADDRESS** | 32          |
| **OPTIONS**           | 0-320 (Optional)|

### Version

- **Length**: 4 bits
- **Purpose**: Identifies the version of IP used (IPv4 or IPv6).
  - **IPv4**: `0100` in binary (decimal 4)
  - **IPv6**: `0110` in binary (decimal 6)

---

### Internet Header Length (IHL)

- **Length**: 4 bits
- **Purpose**: Indicates the total length of the IPv4 header in 4-byte increments.
  - **Minimum Value**: 5 (5 * 4 bytes = 20 bytes)
  - **Maximum Value**: 15 (15 * 4 bytes = 60 bytes)

**Note**: The IPv4 header length can vary between 20 and 60 bytes, depending on the presence of optional fields.

---

### DSCP (Differentiated Services Code Point)

- **Length**: 6 bits
- **Purpose**: Used for Quality of Service (QoS) to prioritize delay-sensitive data, such as streaming voice or video.

---

### ECN (Explicit Congestion Notification)

- **Length**: 2 bits
- **Purpose**: Provides end-to-end notification of network congestion without dropping packets.
- **Note**: Requires support from both endpoints and the network infrastructure.

---

### Total Length

- **Length**: 16 bits
- **Purpose**: Indicates the total length of the packet, including the IPv4 header and the encapsulated Layer 4 segment.
- **Range**:
  - **Minimum**: 20 bytes (header only)
  - **Maximum**: 65,535 bytes (2^16 - 1)

---

### Identification

- **Length**: 16 bits
- **Purpose**: Used to identify fragments of a packet. All fragments of the same packet have the same identification number.
- **Note**: Packets are fragmented if they exceed the Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU), typically 1500 bytes for Ethernet frames.

---

### Flags

- **Length**: 3 bits
- **Purpose**: Controls and identifies packet fragments.
  - **Bit 0**: Reserved (always 0)
  - **Bit 1 (DF - Don't Fragment)**: Indicates if a packet should not be fragmented.
  - **Bit 2 (MF - More Fragments)**: Set to 1 if more fragments follow; 0 for the last fragment or if no fragmentation occurs.

---

### Fragment Offset

- **Length**: 13 bits
- **Purpose**: Indicates the position of the fragment in the original packet. This helps in reassembling the fragments even if they arrive out of order.

---

### Time to Live (TTL)

- **Length**: 8 bits
- **Purpose**: Prevents packets from looping indefinitely. Each router that forwards the packet decreases the TTL by 1. If TTL reaches 0, the packet is discarded.
- **Recommended Default**: 64

---

### Protocol

- **Length**: 8 bits
- **Purpose**: Identifies the encapsulated Layer 4 protocol.
  - **Examples**:
    - `1`: ICMP
    - `6`: TCP
    - `17`: UDP
    - `89`: OSPF (Dynamic Routing Protocol)
- **Note**: A complete list of protocol numbers can be found on [Wikipedia: List of IP Protocol Numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_IP_protocol_numbers).

---

### Header Checksum

- **Length**: 16 bits
- **Purpose**: Ensures the integrity of the IPv4 header by allowing routers to verify its correctness. If the calculated checksum does not match, the packet is dropped.
- **Note**: This checksum only verifies the header, not the encapsulated data. Error detection for the data is handled by the encapsulated protocols, such as TCP or UDP.

---

### Source and Destination Addresses

- **Length**: 32 bits each
- **Purpose**:
  - **Source IP**: The IPv4 address of the sender.
  - **Destination IP**: The IPv4 address of the intended recipient.

---

### Options

- **Length**: 0-320 bits (variable)
- **Purpose**: Optional and rarely used. If the IHL field is greater than 5, options are present.
