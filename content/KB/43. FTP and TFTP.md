## Purpose of FTP and TFTP

**FTP (File Transfer Protocol)** and **TFTP (Trivial File Transfer Protocol)** are industry-standard protocols used for transferring files over a network. Both utilize a **client-server model**:

- **Clients** can:
  - Copy files **from** a server
  - Copy files **to** a server

As a network engineer, one of the most common applications for FTP and TFTP is during the **operating system upgrade** process of a network device. You can download the newer version of IOS from a server and then reboot the device with the updated IOS image.

## TFTP and FTP: Functions and Differences

### TFTP

- **Standardization**: First standardized in 1981.
- **Simplicity**: Named "Trivial" due to its minimalistic design and basic functionality, allowing clients to copy files to and from a server.
- **Not a Replacement**: Released after FTP, it serves as an alternative when lightweight simplicity is prioritized over functionality.
- **No Authentication**: Lacks username/password authentication; servers respond to all requests.
- **No Encryption**: All data is sent in plain text, which can pose security risks.
- **Use Case**: Best suited for controlled environments to transfer small files quickly.
- **Listening Port**: TFTP servers listen on **UDP Port 69**.
- **Connectionless**: Utilizes UDP, which does not provide reliability through retransmissions. However, TFTP incorporates built-in features for acknowledgment.

### TFTP Reliability

- Every TFTP data message is acknowledged:
  - If a client is sending a file to the server, the server sends acknowledgment (ACK) messages.
  - Conversely, if the server is sending a file to the client, the client sends ACK messages.
- **Timers**: If an expected message isn't received in a timely manner, the waiting device will resend its previous message.

### TFTP "Connections"

### Transfer Identifier (TID) (Not in the CCNA Exam)

- When a client sends the first message to the server, the destination port is **UDP 69**, and the source port is a random ephemeral port.
- This "random port" is referred to as a **Transfer Identifier (TID)**, which identifies the data transfer.
- The server also selects a random TID to use as a source port when replying, rather than using UDP 69.
- In subsequent messages, the destination port will be the serverâ€™s TID.

**Note**: UDP Port 69 (TFTP) is only used for the initial request message.

### FTP

- **Standardization**: First standardized in 1971.
- **Ports**: Uses **TCP Ports 20 and 21**.
- **Authentication**: Requires usernames and passwords, although there is no encryption.
- **Secure Alternatives**: For greater security, consider using **FTPS (FTP over SSL/TLS)** or **SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol)**.
- **Complexity**: More complex than TFTP, allowing clients to:
  - Navigate file directories
  - Add or remove files
  - List files, etc.
- **Commands**: Clients send FTP commands to the server to perform these functions.

### FTP Control Connections

- FTP utilizes two types of connections:
  - **Control Connection**: Established over **TCP Port 21** to send FTP commands and replies.
  - **Data Connection**: Separate TCP connections over **TCP Port 20** are established for transferring files.

### Active Mode FTP Data Connections

- The default method for establishing FTP data connections is **Active Mode**, where the server initiates the TCP connection.

- In **Passive Mode**, the client initiates the data connection. This is often necessary when the client is behind a firewall that may block incoming connections from the server.

## IOS File Systems

A file system is a method of controlling how data is stored and retrieved. You can view the file system of a Cisco IOS device using the command:

```
show file systems
```

## Using FTP/TFTP in IOS

To manage your IOS version and file system, the following commands can be utilized:

- View the current version of IOS:
```
show version
```
- View the contents of flash memory:
```
show flash
```
