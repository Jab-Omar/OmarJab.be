## WHAT IS DYNAMIC ROUTING?

![[24_dynamicRouting_01.png]]

Dynamic routing operates at **Layer 3** of the OSI model. It involves configuring a **dynamic routing protocol** on routers, enabling them to automatically discover and maintain optimal paths to destination networks. Unlike static routing, which uses fixed paths, dynamic routing adapts to changes in the network, ensuring optimal routing efficiency.

### Key Definitions:

- **Network Route**: A route to a network or subnet (Mask Length < /32).  
  **Example**: **10.0.12.0/30** and **10.0.13.0/30** are network routes.

- **Host Route**: A route to a specific host (/32).  
  **Example**: **10.0.12.1/32** and **10.0.13.1/32** are host routes.

These routes are automatically added to R1‚Äôs G0/0 and G1/0 interfaces.

## HOW DYNAMIC ROUTING WORKS

![[24_dynamicRouting_03.png]]

In a dynamic routing environment, if R4 advertises its routes to R2, which then advertises them to R1, and R1 to R3, the route to R4 is added to their routing tables. 

If a network route becomes unavailable, it is dynamically removed from the routing table.

![[24_dynamicRouting_04.png]]

In this scenario, R1 removes the route to R4 from its routing table when the connection fails.

**In Static Routing**: A downed router continues to receive traffic, and the routing tables remain unchanged.

![[24_dynamicRouting_05.png]]

Here, R1 has a static route to R4 and continues to forward traffic destined for that network regardless of the status.

To enhance redundancy, an additional connection between R3 and R4 can be implemented.

![[24_dynamicRouting_06.png]]

The secondary dynamic route added from R1 to R4 via R3 updates the routing table accordingly. If the route through R2 fails, traffic is automatically rerouted via R3.

### Cost Preference
The routing preference may depend on the cost associated with each path. This is similar to how the **Spanning Tree Protocol (STP)** operates with switches.

## INTRODUCTION TO DYNAMIC ROUTING PROTOCOLS

Dynamic routing protocols enable routers to advertise information about the routes they know to other routers. 

- Routers establish **adjacencies** or **neighbor relationships** with adjacent routers to facilitate this information exchange.
- If multiple routes to a destination are learned, the router determines the superior route based on the **metric**. The route with the lower metric is considered superior.

---

## TYPES OF DYNAMIC ROUTING PROTOCOLS

Dynamic routing protocols can be divided into two main categories:

1. **IGP (Interior Gateway Protocol)**
   - Used to share routes within a single **autonomous system (AS)**, typically within an organization.

   ![[24_dynamicRouting_08.png]]

2. **EGP (Exterior Gateway Protocol)**
   - Used to share routes between different **autonomous systems (AS)**.

   ![[24_dynamicRouting_09.png]]

### Algorithms and Protocols
Each type of protocol uses specific algorithms:

> **Note**: Memorization of the algorithms associated with each protocol is crucial for the CCNA exam.

## DISTANCE VECTOR ROUTING PROTOCOLS

**Distance Vector** protocols are so named because they communicate only the ‚Äòdistance‚Äô (metric) and ‚Äòvector‚Äô (direction, next-hop router) of each route.

- These protocols were developed before **Link State** protocols.
- Early examples include **RIPv1** and **Cisco's IGRP** (which evolved into **EIGRP**).
  
Distance Vector protocols operate by sharing:
- Their known destination networks.
- The metric to reach these networks.

This method of sharing routing information is often referred to as ***‚Äúrouting by rumor.‚Äù*** This is because the router only knows the network information provided by its neighbors.

## DYNAMIC ROUTING PROTOCOL METRICS

A router's routing table contains the best route to each destination network it knows about. 

When a router using a dynamic routing protocol learns two different routes to the same destination, it determines which is **best** based on the **metric** value.

- **Lower metric = better route!** (similar to STP)

Each routing protocol uses a different metric to evaluate routes.

![[24_dynamicRouting_12.png]]

In the example above, the **red path** is chosen because the cost of using R3's F2/0 and R4's F2/0 (FastEthernet) is higher than the cost of R2's G1/0 and R4's G0/0 (GigabitEthernet).

### Equal Cost Multi-Path (ECMP)
If both connections are of the same type (e.g., both GigabitEthernet), both routes will be added to the routing table, enabling **load balancing** over both routes.

![[24_dynamicRouting_13.png]]

If a router learns multiple routes via the same routing protocol to the same destination (same network address, same subnet mask) with the same metric, all will be added to the routing table.

![[24_dynamicRouting_14.png]]

In this example:
- ‚ÄúO‚Äù indicates the OSPF protocol next to the routes.
- [110/3]: The ‚Äú3‚Äù represents the metric, while the ‚Äú110‚Äù indicates the **administrative distance** (discussed later).

### Summary of Different Metrics

## ADMINISTRATIVE DISTANCE

Most companies typically use a single IGP, commonly **OSPF** or **EIGRP**. In some cases, two different routing protocols may be utilized, especially when two companies connect their networks to share information.

- **Metric** is used to compare routes learned via the same routing protocol.
- Since different routing protocols use different metrics, these cannot be directly compared. For example:
   - An OSPF route to **192.168.4.0/24** might have a metric of **30**, while an EIGRP route to the same destination may have a metric of **33280**.

To determine which routing protocol is preferred, the **Administrative Distance (AD)** is employed. A lower AD indicates a more trustworthy routing protocol.

---

### Administrative Distance Numbers

![[24_dynamicRouting_17.png]]

> **Use flashcards to memorize these values!**

üí° If the **Administrative Distance** is **255**, the router does not trust the source of that route and will not install it in the routing table.

![[24_dynamicRouting_18.png]]

The metric is used to compare routes learned from the same routing protocol. Before comparing metrics, the AD is used to select the best route. 

Thus, the best route might be:
‚Äúnext hop **192.168.3.1**, learned via **OSPF** (lower AD than RIP), metric **10**.‚Äù

- You can change the AD of a routing protocol, which will be demonstrated during the lecture on **OSPF configuration**.
- It is also possible to adjust the AD of a static route:

![[24_dynamicRouting_19.png]]

![[24_dynamicRouting_20.png]]

### Why Would You Want to Do This?

#### Floating Static Routes

By changing the AD of a static route, you can make it less preferred than routes learned by a dynamic routing protocol to the same destination, thereby enabling a backup route in the event of primary route failure.
