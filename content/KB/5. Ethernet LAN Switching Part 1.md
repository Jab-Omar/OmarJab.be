## Local Area Networks (LANs)

- A **LAN** (Local Area Network) is a network confined to a relatively small area, such as a building or a group of nearby buildings.
- **Routers** are used to connect separate LANs, enabling communication between them.

## Ethernet Frame Structure

An **Ethernet Frame** is the basic unit of data transmission in an Ethernet network. It consists of:

1. **Ethernet Header** – Contains crucial control information
2. **Packet** – The encapsulated data being transmitted
3. **Ethernet Trailer** – Includes error-checking information

### Ethernet Header Fields

The Ethernet Header is composed of five fields:

1. **Preamble**:
   - **Length**: 7 bytes (56 bits)
   - Consists of a sequence of alternating 1's and 0's (`10101010` repeated 7 times)
   - Purpose: Allows devices to synchronize their receiver clocks before data transmission begins

2. **SFD (Start Frame Delimiter)**:
   - **Length**: 1 byte (8 bits)
   - Bit pattern: `10101011`
   - Purpose: Marks the end of the preamble and the beginning of the actual data in the frame

3. **Destination & Source Addresses**:
   - **Length**: 6 bytes each (48 bits)
   - These are Layer 2 addresses known as **MAC Addresses** (Media Access Control)
   - Purpose: Identify the sending and receiving devices on the network

4. **Type/Length**:
   - **Length**: 2 bytes (16 bits)
   - This field can indicate either:
     - The **length** of the encapsulated packet (if the value is 1500 or less)
     - The **type** of protocol in the encapsulated packet (if the value is 1536 or greater)
   - Common types:
     - **IPv4**: 0x0800 (hexadecimal) = 2048 (decimal)
     - **IPv6**: 0x86DD (hexadecimal) = 34525 (decimal)

### Ethernet Trailer

The Ethernet Trailer contains the **Frame Check Sequence (FCS)**:

- **Length**: 4 bytes (32 bits)
- Purpose: Detects corrupted data by using a **Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC)** algorithm on the frame’s contents

**Total Size of an Ethernet Frame**: 26 bytes (combining the header and trailer)

## MAC Address (Media Access Control)

- A **MAC Address** is a unique 6-byte (48-bit) address assigned to a device when it is manufactured.
- Also known as the **Burned-In Address (BIA)**.
- **Globally Unique**:
  - The first 3 bytes represent the **OUI (Organizationally Unique Identifier)**, assigned to the device manufacturer.
  - The last 3 bytes are unique to the specific device.

**Example**:
- `E8:BA:70:11:28:74`
  - `E8:BA:70` represents the OUI
  - `11:28:74` is the unique identifier for the device

## Interface Names

- **F0/1, F0/2, F0/3...** – The "F" stands for **Fast Ethernet**, indicating 100 Mbps interfaces.

## MAC Address Table

Each switch maintains a **Dynamic MAC Address Table**, which is populated by the **Source MAC Address** of incoming frames.

### Frame Handling Process

- **Unknown Unicast Frame**:
  - If the switch does not recognize the destination MAC address (i.e., it is not in the MAC Address Table), the switch will **flood** the frame. This means it will forward the frame out of all interfaces except the one it received the frame on.
  
- **Known Unicast Frame**:
  - If the MAC address is recognized (i.e., it is in the MAC Address Table), the switch will **forward** the frame to the correct interface.

- **Note**: Dynamic MAC Addresses are automatically removed from the MAC Address Table after 5 minutes of inactivity.
