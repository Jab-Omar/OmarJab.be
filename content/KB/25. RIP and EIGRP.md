## ROUTING INFORMATION PROTOCOL (RIP)

- **Routing Information Protocol (RIP)** is an industry-standard **Distance Vector IGP**.
- Utilizes **Routing-By-Rumor** logic to learn and share routes.
- Employs **HOP COUNT** as its metric (one router = one hop); bandwidth is irrelevant.
- Maximum hop count is **15** (any hop count greater than 15 is considered unreachable).
- There are **three versions**:
  - **RIPv1** and **RIPv2** for IPv4
  - **RIPng** (RIP Next Generation) for IPv6
- Uses **two message types**:
  - **REQUEST**: Asks RIP-enabled neighbor routers to send their routing tables.
  - **RESPONSE**: Sends the local router's routing table to neighboring routers.

By default, RIP-enabled routers share their routing table every **30 seconds**.

### RIPv1 and RIPv2

- **RIPv1**:
  - Only advertises **classful addresses** (Class A, Class B, Class C).
  - Does not support **VLSM** or **CIDR**.
  - Does not include subnet mask information in advertisements.
    - Example:
      - `10.1.1.0/24` becomes `10.0.0.0` (assumed to be /8).
      - `172.16.192.0/18` becomes `172.16.0.0` (assumed to be /16).
      - `192.168.1.40/30` becomes `192.168.1.0` (assumed to be /24).
  - Messages are broadcast to `255.255.255.255`.

- **RIPv2**:
  - Supports **VLSM** and **CIDR**.
  - Includes subnet mask information in advertisements.
  - Messages are **multicast** to `224.0.0.9`.
    - Broadcast messages are delivered to all devices on the local network.
    - Multicast messages are delivered only to devices that have joined that specific multicast group.

## CONFIGURING RIP

![[25_ripAndEigrp_01.png]]

The **‚Äúnetwork‚Äù** command tells the router to:

- Look for interfaces with an IP address in the specified range.
- Activate RIP on the interfaces that fall within this range.
- Form adjacencies with connected RIP neighbors.
- Advertise the **network prefix** of the interface (not the prefix in the ‚Äúnetwork‚Äù command).

The OSPF and EIGRP **‚Äúnetwork‚Äù** commands operate similarly. Because the RIP ‚Äúnetwork‚Äù command is classful, it will automatically convert to classful networks:

- `10.0.0.0` is assumed to be `10.0.0.0/8`.
  - R1 looks for any interfaces with an IP address that matches `10.0.0.0/8` (only needs to match the first 8 bits).
  - `10.0.12.1` and `10.0.13.1` both match, so RIP is activated on G0/0 and G0/1.
  - R1 then advertises `10.0.12.0/30` and `10.0.13.0/30` (not `10.0.0.0/8`) to its RIP neighbors.

![[25_ripAndEigrp_02.png]]

- The ‚Äúnetwork‚Äù command for `172.16.0.0` is assumed to be `172.16.0.0/16`.
- R1 looks for any interfaces matching `172.16.0.0/16`.
- `172.16.1.14` matches, so R1 activates RIP on G2/0.
- There are no RIP neighbors connected to G2/0, so no new adjacencies are formed.
  - Although there are no RIP neighbors, R1 will still send advertisements out of G2/0. This creates unnecessary traffic, so G2/0 should be configured as a **passive interface**.

![[25_ripAndEigrp_03.png]]

- The **‚Äúpassive-interface‚Äù** command tells the router to stop sending RIP advertisements out of the specified interface (G2/0).
- However, the router will continue to advertise the network prefix of the interface (`172.16.1.0/28`) to its RIP neighbors (R2, R3).
- You should always use this command on interfaces that do not have any RIP neighbors.
- EIGRP and OSPF both have the same passive interface functionality, using the same command.

## HOW TO ADVERTISE A DEFAULT ROUTE INTO RIP

![[25_ripAndEigrp_04.png]]

![[25_ripAndEigrp_05.png]]

To share the default route with R1‚Äôs RIP neighbors, use this command:

![[25_ripAndEigrp_06.png]]

RIP doesn‚Äôt consider interface administrative costs (RIP cost is 120); it only counts hops.

Since both paths have an equal number of hops, both paths appear in the default route (Gateway of Last Resort).

## Viewing RIP Configuration

To view RIP protocols, use:

- **`show ip protocols`** for RIP

![[25_ripAndEigrp_08.png]]

- ‚ÄúMaximum path: 4‚Äù is the default but can be changed with this command:

![[25_ripAndEigrp_09.png]]

- **‚ÄúDistance‚Äù (AD)** can be changed with this command (default is 120).

## ENHANCED INTERIOR GATEWAY ROUTING PROTOCOL (EIGRP)

- **Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol** is a **Distance Vector IGP**.
- Originally Cisco proprietary, but now published openly for other vendors.
- Considered an ‚Äúadvanced‚Äù/‚Äúhybrid‚Äù Distance Vector Routing Protocol.
- Much faster than RIP in reacting to changes in the network.
- Does **not** have the 15 hop count limit of RIP.
- Sends messages using **multicast address `224.0.0.10`** (remember this number).
- The only IGP that can perform **unequal-cost load balancing** (by default, it performs **ECMP** load balancing over 4 paths, like RIP).

---

## CONFIGURATION OF EIGRP

![[25_ripAndEigrp_11.png]]

Use the command **`router eigrp <Autonomous System number>`**:

- The **AS** (Autonomous System) number **must match** between routers; otherwise, they will not form an adjacency and share route information.
- Auto-summary might be **enabled or disabled** by default, depending on the router/IOS version. If enabled, disable it.
- The **‚Äúnetwork‚Äù** command will assume a classful address if you don‚Äôt specify the subnet mask.
- EIGRP uses a **wildcard mask** instead of a regular subnet mask.

### Wildcard Mask

A wildcard mask is an ‚Äúinverted‚Äù subnet mask:

- All **1‚Äôs** in the subnet mask become **0** in the wildcard mask.
- All **0‚Äôs** in the subnet mask become **1** in the wildcard mask.

![[25_ripAndEigrp_12.png]]

- **`0`** in the wildcard mask means **bits must match**!
- **`1`** in the wildcard mask means **do not have to match**.

## Viewing EIGRP Configuration

To view EIGRP protocols, use:

- **`show ip protocols`** for EIGRP

![[25_ripAndEigrp_16.png]]

### Router ID

**Router ID** order of priority:

1. Manual configuration
2. Highest IP address on a **loopback interface**
3. Highest IP address on a **physical interface**

![[25_ripAndEigrp_17.png]]

### Distance (AD)

EIGRP has two values:

- **Internal** = 90
- **External** = 170

**Memorize these values!**

To view the routing table for EIGRP, use:

- **`show ip route`** for EIGRP

![[25_ripAndEigrp_18.png]]

Note the large metric numbers. This is a downside to EIGRP, even on small networks!

---

## EIGRP METRIC

By default, EIGRP uses **bandwidth** and **delay** to calculate its metric.

### Default ‚ÄúK‚Äù Values

- **K1** = 1
- **K2** = 0
- **K3** = 1
- **K4** = 0
- **K5** = 0

üí° **Simplified calculation**: 
\[ \text{Metric} = \text{Bandwidth (Slowest Link)} + \text{Delay (of ALL LINKS)} \]

---

## EIGRP TERMINOLOGY

- **Feasible Distance**: This router‚Äôs metric value to the route‚Äôs destination.
- **Reported Distance** (aka **Advertised Distance**): The neighbor‚Äôs metric value to the route‚Äôs destination.

![[25_ripAndEigrp_19.png]]

## SUMMARY

- **RIP** is classful, based on hop count, with a maximum of 15 hops.
- **EIGRP** is considered an advanced distance vector protocol that utilizes bandwidth and delay for metric calculation and can perform unequal-cost load balancing.
