## What is Dynamic ARP Inspection (DAI)?

### ARP Review
- **ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)** is used to learn the **MAC address** of another device when its **IP address** is known.
  - **Example:** A PC utilizes ARP to determine the **MAC address** of its **default gateway** for communication with external networks.
- ARP typically consists of a **two-message exchange**:
  - **ARP Request:** Sent to inquire about a device’s MAC address.
  - **ARP Reply:** Response that provides the requested MAC address.

### Gratuitous ARP (GARP)
- A **Gratuitous ARP message** is an ARP reply sent **without** an accompanying ARP request.
- It is broadcasted to the **broadcast MAC address**.
- Purpose:
  - Allows other devices on the network to learn the MAC address of the sending device without needing to send ARP requests.
  - Some devices automatically send GARP messages when:
    - An interface is enabled.
    - An IP address is changed.
    - A MAC address is changed.

## Dynamic ARP Inspection (DAI)
- **DAI** is a **security feature** on switches that filters ARP messages received on **untrusted ports**.
- It only filters ARP messages; **non-ARP messages** are not affected.
- By default, all ports are considered **untrusted**.
  - Typically, ports connected to **network devices** (e.g., switches, routers) should be configured as **trusted**, while interfaces connected to **end hosts** should remain **untrusted**.

## ARP Poisoning (Man-in-the-Middle Attack)
- Similar to **DHCP poisoning**, **ARP poisoning** involves an attacker manipulating the target’s ARP tables, redirecting traffic to themselves.
- To execute this, the attacker can send **gratuitous ARP messages** using the **IP address** of another device.
- Other devices in the network receive the GARP, leading them to update their ARP tables, which results in sending traffic to the attacker instead of the legitimate destination.

## DAI Operations
- DAI inspects the **Sender MAC** and **Sender IP** fields of ARP messages received on **untrusted ports** and checks for a matching entry in the **DHCP Snooping Binding Table**.
  - **If there is a match**, the ARP message is **forwarded**.
  - **If there is no match**, the ARP message is **discarded**.

- DAI does **not inspect** messages received on **trusted ports**; they are forwarded normally.
- **ARP ACLs (Access Control Lists)** can be manually configured to map specific **IP addresses** to **MAC addresses** for DAI to check.
  - This is useful for hosts that do not use DHCP.
- DAI can also be configured for more in-depth checks, although these are optional.
- Similar to DHCP Snooping, DAI supports **rate-limiting** to prevent attackers from overwhelming the switch with ARP messages.
  - Both **DHCP Snooping** and **DAI** require processing power from the switch’s CPU.
  - Even if the attacker’s messages are blocked, they can still overload the switch’s CPU with ARP messages.

## ARP ACLs (Advanced Topic Beyond CCNA Scope)

### Create an ARP ACL for SRV1

![[51_dynamicArpInspection_13.png]]

After applying it to **Switch 2**, SRV1 can successfully send an **ARP request** to **R1**.

![[51_dynamicArpInspection_14.png]]

**Command:**  
```bash
show ip arp inspection
```
This command displays a summary of the **DAI configuration** and statistics.
