## Private IPv4 Addresses (RFC 1918)

- The **IPv4 addressing scheme** does not provide enough addresses for all devices requiring an IP address in today's digital landscape.
- The long-term solution is transitioning to **IPv6**. However, there are three primary short-term solutions:
  - **CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing)**
  - **Private IPv4 Addresses**
  - **NAT (Network Address Translation)**

### RFC 1918 Private Address Ranges

RFC 1918 specifies the following IPv4 address ranges as private:

```
10.0.0.0 /8       (10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255)             CLASS A 
172.16.0.0 /12    (172.16.0.0 to 172.31.255.255)           CLASS B
192.168.0.0 /16   (192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255)         CLASS C
```

- These addresses can be freely used within your networks and do not need to be globally unique.

## Introduction to NAT

**Network Address Translation (NAT)** is a method used to modify the source and/or destination IP addresses of packets as they pass through a router or firewall. 

### Common Uses of NAT

- The most common application of NAT is to allow hosts with private IP addresses to communicate with other hosts over the **Internet**.
- For the CCNA certification, it's essential to understand **Source NAT** and how to configure it on Cisco routers.

## Static NAT

- **Static NAT** involves configuring one-to-one mappings between private IP addresses and public addresses. This means that each private IP address has a fixed corresponding public IP address.

### Important Note

- A private IP address cannot be mapped to the same global IP address multiple times; the second mapping will be rejected.

### Useful Commands

- **To clear NAT translations**: 
  ```
  clear ip nat translation
  ```

- **To view NAT statistics**: 
  ```
  show ip nat statistics
  ```
