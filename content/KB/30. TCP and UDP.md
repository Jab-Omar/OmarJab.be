## Basics of Layer 4

Layer 4 of the OSI model, also known as the Transport Layer, is responsible for the transparent transfer of data between end hosts, ensuring that communication is reliable and orderly.

#### Key Functions:
- **Reliable Data Transfer:** Ensures data is delivered accurately and in the correct order.
- **Error Recovery:** Detects and retransmits lost or corrupted data.
- **Data Sequencing:** Organizes data packets in the correct sequence.
- **Flow Control:** Manages the rate of data transmission to prevent overwhelming the destination.
- **Layer 4 Addressing (Port Numbers):** Identifies the specific application layer protocol. It does **not** refer to physical interfaces or ports on network devices.
- **Session Multiplexing:** Allows multiple sessions to coexist on the same device.

### What is a Session?

A **session** is an exchange of data between two or more communicating devices. Each session can be identified by unique port numbers, and these ports are categorized as follows:

![[30_tcpAndUdp_02.png]]

#### Port Ranges:
- **Well-Known Port Numbers:** 0 - 1023 (e.g., HTTP, FTP)
- **Registered Port Numbers:** 1024 - 49151 (e.g., applications registered with IANA)
- **Ephemeral/Private/Dynamic Port Numbers:** 49152 - 65535 (e.g., temporary ports for client applications)

### TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)

**TCP** is a connection-oriented protocol, meaning it requires a connection to be established between two hosts before data can be sent. This ensures a reliable and ordered data exchange.

![[30_tcpAndUdp_04.png]]

#### Connection Establishment:
- **Three-Way Handshake:** 
  1. **SYN:** Host A sends a SYN (synchronize) packet to Host B.
  2. **SYN-ACK:** Host B responds with a SYN-ACK (synchronize-acknowledge).
  3. **ACK:** Host A sends an ACK (acknowledge), and the connection is established.

#### Connection Termination:
- **Four-Step Process:**
  1. **FIN:** Host A sends a FIN (finish) to Host B.
  2. **ACK:** Host B acknowledges with an ACK.
  3. **FIN:** Host B sends a FIN.
  4. **ACK:** Host A sends an ACK, closing the connection.

#### Key Features:
- **Reliable Communication:** TCP ensures the destination host acknowledges receipt of each TCP segment (Layer 4 PDU). If a segment isn't acknowledged, it is retransmitted.

![[30_tcpAndUdp_08.png]]

- **Data Sequencing:** Sequence numbers in the TCP header allow the destination host to reorder segments that arrive out of sequence.

![[30_tcpAndUdp_09.png]]

- **Flow Control:** The destination host can instruct the source host to adjust the rate of data transmission to prevent buffer overflow.

### UDP (User Datagram Protocol)

**UDP** is a simpler, connectionless protocol, where data is sent without establishing a connection. This means UDP does not guarantee reliable communication.

![[30_tcpAndUdp_12.png]]

#### Key Characteristics:
- **No Connection Establishment:** Data is sent without prior communication between the sending and receiving hosts.
- **No Reliability:** There are no acknowledgments for received segments, and lost segments are not retransmitted.
- **No Sequencing:** UDP has no mechanism for ordering segments, so out-of-order segments cannot be corrected.
- **No Flow Control:** UDP does not regulate the rate of data transmission.
- **Error Checking:** UDP includes a checksum for basic error detection, but it does not provide the robust error recovery features of TCP.

### Comparing TCP and UDP

#### Header Fields:

![[30_tcpAndUdp_13.png]]

- **TCP** includes more features than UDP, providing reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery at the cost of additional overhead.
- **UDP** is simpler and faster, making it ideal for applications that can tolerate some data loss, such as streaming audio or video.

#### Application Use:
- **TCP:** Preferred for applications that require reliable communication, such as file transfers.
- **UDP:** Preferred for real-time applications where speed is critical, and occasional data loss is acceptable.
- **Mixed Use:** Some applications use both TCP and UDP depending on the context, offering flexibility.
