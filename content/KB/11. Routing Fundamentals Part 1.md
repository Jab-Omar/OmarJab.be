## WHAT IS ROUTING?

Routing is the process used by routers to determine the best path for IP packets to travel across a network to reach their intended destination.

- **Routing Tables**: Routers store routes to all known destinations in a routing table. When a router receives a packet, it consults this table to find the best route for forwarding the packet.

## Two Main Routing Methods

1. **Dynamic Routing**:
   - **Automated**: Routers use dynamic routing protocols (e.g., OSPF) to automatically share routing information and build their routing tables.

2. **Static Routing**:
   - **Manual Configuration**: A network engineer or administrator manually configures routes on the router.

## What a Route Tells the Router

- **Next-Hop Routing**: For a packet destined for X, the router sends it to the next-hop Y.
- **Directly Connected**: If the destination is directly connected, the router sends the packet directly to the destination.
- **Self-Addressed**: If the destination is the routerâ€™s own IP address, the router keeps the packet (it does not forward it).

## WAN (Wide Area Network)

A WAN is a network that extends over a large geographic area, connecting multiple smaller networks, such as LANs.
