## Purpose of FHRPs

![FHRP Overview](29_firstHopRedundancyprotocols_01.png)

- **Problem**: What happens if the configured **Default Gateway** for network hosts goes down? Routed traffic will be disrupted.
- **Solution**: FHRPs ensure that traffic can be rerouted to a functional gateway (like R2) when the primary gateway fails.

---

## What is FHRP?

- **Definition**: A computer networking protocol designed to **protect the default gateway** on a subnet by allowing multiple routers to provide backup for that address.
- **Function**: In case of failure of the active router, a backup router takes over, usually within seconds.

---

## How FHRP Works

- **Shared Virtual IP (VIP)**: Two or more routers share a **Virtual IP address** (VIP), which is used by hosts as the default gateway IP.
- **Communication**: Routers send “Hello” messages to each other. One router is **Active**, and the other(s) are **Standby**.
- **Traffic Flow**: 
  - When a host sends traffic outside the network, it first sends an **ARP Request** to the VIP to get its MAC address.
  - The **Active Router** responds with a **Virtual MAC address**.
  - The host then sends traffic to the outside network using:
    - **Source IP**: Host IP
    - **Destination IP**: External IP
    - **Source MAC**: Host MAC
    - **Destination MAC**: Gateway VIP MAC

- **Failover**: If the active router (R1) goes down, the standby router (R2) takes over after detecting the absence of “Hello” messages from R1.

- **Gratuitous ARP**: 
  - The new active router (R2) sends a **Gratuitous ARP** to update switches.
  - **Gratuitous ARP**: An unsolicited ARP reply sent via broadcast (FFFF.FFFF.FFFF), different from the usual unicast ARP reply.

## What Happens When R1 Comes Back Online?

- **Role**: R1 becomes the **Standby Router**.
- **Active Router**: R2 remains the **Active Router**.
- **Non-preemptive Behavior**: FHRPs are typically non-preemptive, meaning the current active router will not give up its role even if the original active router comes back online.
- **Preemption**: This setting can be changed to allow R1 to preempt R2 and take back its active role.

## Types of FHRPs

### 1. HSRP (Hot Standby Router Protocol)

- **Type**: Cisco proprietary
- **Roles**: Active and Standby routers
- **Versions**:
  - **Version 1**
  - **Version 2**: Adds IPv6 support and increases the number of groups that can be configured.
- **Multicast IPv4 Addresses**:
  - **v1**: 224.0.0.2
  - **v2**: 224.0.0.102
- **Virtual MAC Addresses**:
  - **v1**: 0000.0c07.acXX (XX = HSRP Group Number)
  - **v2**: 0000.0c9f.fXXX (XXX = HSRP Group Number)
- **Load Balancing**: Different active routers can be configured for each subnet/VLAN.

### 2. VRRP (Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol)

- **Type**: Open Standard
- **Roles**: Master and Backup routers
- **Multicast IPv4 Address**: 224.0.0.18
- **Virtual MAC Address**: 0000.5e00.01XX (XX = VRRP Group Number)
  - For group numbers > 99, convert to HEX (e.g., 200 = “c8” in HEX, so the MAC would be 0000.5e00.01c8).
- **Load Balancing**: Different master routers can be configured for each subnet/VLAN.

### 3. GLBP (Gateway Load Balancing Protocol)

- **Type**: Cisco proprietary
- **Function**: Load balances among multiple routers within a single subnet.
- **Roles**:
  - **AVG (Active Virtual Gateway)**: Elected leader.
  - **AVFs (Active Virtual Forwarders)**: Up to four, assigned by the AVG (the AVG can also be an AVF).
  - Each AVF acts as the default gateway for a portion of the hosts in the subnet.
- **Multicast IPv4 Address**: 224.0.0.102
- **Virtual MAC Address**: 0007.b400.XXYY (XX = GLBP Group Number, YY = AVF Number)

## Basic HSRP Configuration

### R1 Configuration:

![R1 Configuration](29_firstHopRedundancyprotocols_09.png)

**Note**: The group number must match on all routers being configured in a given subnet.

### R2 Configuration:

![R2 Configuration](29_firstHopRedundancyprotocols_11.png)

**Note**: HSRP versions are not cross-compatible. All routers must use the same HSRP version.
