## Redundancy in Networks

- **Redundancy** is critical in modern network design to ensure continuous availability.
- Networks are expected to operate **24/7/365**, and even brief downtimes can be detrimental to business operations.
- Redundancy ensures that if one network component fails, other components can take over seamlessly, minimizing or eliminating downtime.

### Poor Network Design Example

![[20_stpPart1_01.png]]

- This design has multiple **single points of failure**, where a single failure could disrupt the entire network.

### Improved Network Design

![[20_stpPart1_02.png]]

- This design incorporates redundancy, ensuring that failure in one component does not bring down the entire network.

## The Downside of Redundancy: Broadcast Storms

While redundancy is beneficial, it can lead to **Layer 2 loops**, causing network issues like broadcast storms.

### Broadcast Storms

- A broadcast storm occurs when broadcast frames circulate endlessly in a loop, causing network congestion.
- The excessive traffic can overwhelm network resources, leading to significant degradation in performance.

### MAC Address Flapping

- **MAC Address Flapping** happens when a switch repeatedly updates its MAC address table because the same source MAC address is detected on different ports due to loops.
- This constant updating can cause instability in the network.

## Spanning Tree Protocol (STP): 802.1D

To prevent Layer 2 loops in a network with redundant paths, we use the **Spanning Tree Protocol (STP)**.

### What is STP?

- STP is defined in the **IEEE 802.1D** standard.
- It prevents Layer 2 loops by placing redundant ports in a **blocking state**, essentially disabling those interfaces until needed.
- If an active forwarding interface fails, the blocked ports can switch to a **forwarding state** to maintain connectivity.
- Ports in the blocking state only send or receive STP messages, known as **Bridge Protocol Data Units (BPDUs)**.

**Note:** STP still uses the term "bridge," which historically referred to devices used to connect network segments. In modern networks, **switches** fulfill this role.

- The **orange interface** is blocked, breaking the loop and preventing broadcast storms and MAC address flapping.

### How STP Works

- STP selects which ports should be **forwarding** and which should be **blocking** to create a single, loop-free path through the network.
- STP-enabled switches send and receive **Hello BPDUs** out of all interfaces, typically once every two seconds per interface.
- If a switch receives a Hello BPDU on an interface, it knows that the interface is connected to another switch (since routers, PCs, etc., do not use STP and therefore do not send Hello BPDUs).

## BPDU and Root Bridge Election

**BPDUs** contain crucial information used by switches to elect a **Root Bridge** for the network.

- The switch with the lowest **Bridge ID** becomes the Root Bridge.
- All ports on the Root Bridge are placed in a **forwarding state**, while other switches in the topology must establish a path to the Root Bridge.

### Bridge Priority

- **Bridge Priority** can be adjusted in increments of **4096** to influence which switch becomes the Root Bridge.

![[20_stpPart1_11.png]]

- In the example topology, **SW1** becomes the Root Bridge due to its MAC address being the lowest.

![[20_stpPart1_12.png]]

- All interfaces on the Root Bridge are **Designated Ports**, which are always in a **forwarding state**.

## STP Steps

1. **Root Bridge Election**: 
   - The switch with the lowest **Bridge ID** becomes the Root Bridge.
   - If the Bridge ID is tied, the switch with the lowest MAC address wins.
   - All ports on the Root Bridge are **Designated Ports** in a **forwarding state**.

2. **Root Port Selection**:
   - Each remaining switch selects one of its interfaces to be its **Root Port** (the port with the lowest **Root Path Cost**).
   - Ports across from the Root Port on other switches are always **Designated Ports**.

3. **Designated Port Selection**:
   - In each collision domain, one interface is selected as the **Designated Port** (forwarding state).
   - The other port in the collision domain becomes **Non-Designated** (blocking state).

### STP Cost Chart

- Only outgoing interfaces toward the Root Bridge have an STP cost. The cost is the sum of all outgoing port costs until reaching the Root Bridge.

![[20_stpPart1_13.png]]

- SW1, as the Root Bridge, has an STP cost of **0** on all interfaces.

![[20_stpPart1_14.png]]

- Ports connected to another switch's Root Port must be **Designated Ports** (D).

![[20_stpPart1_15.png]]

- In case of a tie, the **Neighbor Switch Port ID** is used as a tiebreaker.

## Determining Which Port Will Be Blocked

## Quiz: Identify the Root Bridge and Interface Roles

**Example 1:**

![[20_stpPart1_18.png]]

- All switches have the same priority number (32769), so the tiebreaker goes to the switch with the **lowest MAC address**.
- **SW3** has the lowest MAC address, so it becomes the Root Bridge, and all its interfaces become Designated Ports.
- **SW1** (G0/1) and **SW4** (G0/0) interfaces connected to SW3 become Root Ports.
- Since **SW2** has two connections to SW1, SW1's incoming interfaces both become Designated Ports.
- **SW2** (G0/2) becomes a Root Port because SW1's G0/0 interface has a lower cost than its G0/2 interface.
- The remaining interfaces on SW2 become Non-Designated because it has the highest Root Cost (12), and the interfaces they are connected to on other switches become Designated Ports.

**Example 2:**

![[20_stpPart1_19.png]]

- **SW4** has the lowest priority number, so it becomes the Root Bridge, and all its interfaces become Designated Ports.
- **SW2** (G0/0) becomes the Root Port because SW4's G0/0 connection has a lower number than G0/1.
- **SW3** (G0/1) becomes the Root Port.
- **SW1** (G0/1) becomes the Root Port because G0/1 has a lower cost than Fa1/0 and 2/0.
- The remaining ports on SW1 and SW2 will either be Designated or Non-Designated based on the STP cost and priority.
