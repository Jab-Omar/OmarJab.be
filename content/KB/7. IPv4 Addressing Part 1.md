### OSI Model - Network Layer (Layer 3)

- **Purpose**: Provides connectivity between end hosts on different networks (i.e., outside of the LAN).
- **Key Functions**:
  - Logical addressing (IP addresses).
  - Path selection between source and destination.
- **Devices**: Routers operate at Layer 3.

### Routing

- **Switches** (Layer 2 devices) connect and expand networks within the same LAN. They do not separate different networks.
- **Routers**: By introducing a router between two switches, you split the network into two separate networks, each with its own network IP address.

**Example**:
- **Network 1**: 192.168.1.0/24 (255.255.255.0)
- **Network 2**: 192.168.2.0/24 (255.255.255.0)

![Network Split with Router](07_ipv4AddressingP1_01.png)

Routers have unique IP addresses for each of their interfaces, depending on their location:

- **G0/0 Interface**: 192.168.1.254/24
- **G0/1 Interface**: 192.168.2.254/24

![Router Interface IP Addresses](07_ipv4AddressingP1_02.png)

- The IP address of a router's interface depends on the network address of the LAN it connects to.
- The **network portion** of an IP address is the same for all hosts on a given LAN.
  
**Example**:

- 192.168.1.100
- 192.168.1.105
- 192.168.1.205

All of these IP addresses belong to the same network because the network portion (192.168.1) is the same, while the host portion (100, 105, 205) is unique.

- **Broadcast Messages**: When a broadcast message reaches a router, it does not continue beyond the local LAN; it stays within the switch/hosts.

### IPv4 Header

![IPv4 Header Structure](07_ipv4AddressingP1_03.png)

- **IPv4 (Internet Protocol version 4)**: The primary Layer 3 protocol in use today.
- **IPv4 Headers**: Contain more fields than Ethernet headers.
- Important fields include the **Source IP Address** and **Destination IP Address**, each 32 bits (4 bytes) in length.

**Example**:

- IP Address: 192.168.1.254
- Each decimal number in an IP address represents 8 bits, and these 8-bit groups are referred to as **octets**.

**Binary Representation**:

- 192.168.1.254 → 11000000 . 10101000 . 00000001 . 11111110
- **Note**: Binary is difficult to read for humans, so we use the **Dotted Decimal** format.

### Review of Decimal and Hexadecimal

![Decimal and Hexadecimal Conversion](07_ipv4AddressingP1_04.png)

- **Decimal (Base 10)**: 
  - Example: 3294 = (3 * 1000) + (2 * 100) + (9 * 10) + (4 * 1)
  
- **Hexadecimal (Base 16)**:
  - Example: 3294 in hexadecimal is CDE
  ```
  C (C * 256 / 12 * 256 = 3072)  // 256ths position
  D (D * 16 / D=13 so 16*13 = 208) // 16ths position
  E (E * 1 / E = 14)  // 1s position
  ```
  - Adding these up, we get 3294.

### Converting Decimal to Binary

**Example 1**: Convert 221 to Binary.

- Steps:
  ```
  221 - 128 = 93  → 1 in the "128" slot → 10000000
  93 - 64 = 29   → 1 in the "64" slot  → 11000000
  29 - 32 = not possible → 0 in the "32" slot
  29 - 16 = 13  → 1 in the "16" slot  → 11010000
  13 - 8 = 5  → 1 in the "8" slot  → 11011000
  5 - 4 = 1  → 1 in the "4" slot  → 11011100
  1 - 2 = not possible → 0 in the "2" slot
  1 - 1 = possible  → 1 in the "1" slot  → 11011101
  ```
  - The binary representation of 221 is **11011101**.

**Example 2**: Convert 127 to Binary.

- Steps:
  ```
  127 - 128 = not possible  → 0 in the "128" slot

  63 - 32 = 31  → 1 in the "32" slot  → 01110000
  31 - 16 = 15  → 1 in the "16" slot  → 01111000
  15 - 8 = 7  → 1 in the "8" slot  → 01111100
  7 - 4 = 3  → 1 in the "4" slot  → 01111110
  3 - 2 = 1  → 1 in the "2" slot  → 01111111
  1 is possible  → 1 in the "1" slot  → 01111111
  ```
  - The binary representation of 127 is **01111111**.

**Example 3**: Convert 207 to Binary.

- Steps:
  ```
  255 - 207 = 48 → The remainder helps find where the 0's are.
  32 + 16 = 48  → This indicates the 0's in the binary.
  ```
  - The binary representation of 207 is **11001111**.

### IPv4 Addresses

IP addresses are the Dotted Decimal conversion of a series of binary numbers broken into four octets.

**Example**: 192.168.1.254/24

- The **/24** indicates that the first 24 bits represent the network portion of the address.
- In this case, **192.168.1** is the network portion (first 3 octets), and **.254** is the host portion (last octet).

### Converting Binary to IPv4 Address

**Example 1**: Convert 10011010010011100110111100100000 to IPv4.

- Steps:
  ```
  10011010 . 01001110 . 01101111 . 00100000
  154 + 78 + 111 + 32 = 154.78.111.32
  ```
  - The IPv4 address is **154.78.111.32/16** (154.78 = Network, 111.32 = Host).

**Example 2**: Convert 00001100100000001111101100010111 to IPv4.

- Steps:
  ```
  00001100 . 10000000 . 11111011 . 00010111
  12 + 128 + 251 + 23 = 12.128.251.23
  ```
  - The IPv4 address is **12.128.251.23/8** (12 = Network, 128.251.23 = Host).

### IPv4 Address Classes

IPv4 addresses are divided into 5 different classes, determined by the first octet.

| Class | First Octet Binary | First Octet

 Numeric Range |
|-------|--------------------|---------------------------|
| A     | 0xxxxxxx            | 0-126 (+127 for loopback) |
| B     | 10xxxxxx            | 128-191                   |
| C     | 110xxxxx            | 192-223                   |
| D     | 1110xxxx            | 224-239 (Multicast)       |
| E     | 1111xxxx            | 240-255 (Experimental)    |

### Netmask

A netmask is written like a Dotted Decimal IP address and indicates the length of the network portion of an address.

- **Class A**: /8 → 255.0.0.0
- **Class B**: /16 → 255.255.0.0
- **Class C**: /24 → 255.255.255.0

![Netmask Example](07_ipv4AddressingP1_09.png)

---

### Network Addresses

- If the **host portion** of an IP address is all 0's, it signifies the **network address**—the identifier of the network itself.

**Example**: 192.168.1.0/24 represents a network address and cannot be assigned to a host.

![Network Address Example](07_ipv4AddressingP1_10.png)

- If the **host portion** of an IP address is all 1's, it represents the **broadcast address** for the network and cannot be assigned to a host.

**Example**:

- **Destination IP**: 192.168.1.255 (Broadcast IP address)
- **Destination MAC**: FFFF.FFFF.FFFF (Broadcast MAC address)

![Broadcast Address Example](07_ipv4AddressingP1_11.png)

- Because of these two reserved addresses, the range of usable host addresses is **1 to 254** for a /24 network.
