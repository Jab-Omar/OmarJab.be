### IP Phones and Voice VLANs

- Traditional telephony operates over the *Public Switched Telephone Network* (PSTN), often referred to as *POTS* (Plain Old Telephone System).
- Modern telephony uses **IP phones**, which employ **VoIP (Voice over IP)** technology, allowing phone calls over IP networks like the Internet.
- **IP phones** are connected to network switches, similar to how computers and other hosts connect.

#### Internal Structure of IP Phones

- IP phones have an internal **3-port switch**:
  - **Port 1**: Uplink to the external network switch.
  - **Port 2**: Downlink to the PC.
  - **Port 3**: Connection to the phone itself.

- This design enables the PC and the IP phone to share a single switch port, with the PC’s traffic passing through the IP phone.
- **Best Practice**: Separate **voice traffic** (from the IP phone) and **data traffic** (from the PC) into separate VLANs:
  - The PC’s traffic will be **untagged**.
  - The phone’s traffic will be **tagged** with a VLAN ID for the voice VLAN.

### Power over Ethernet (PoE)

- **PoE** allows Power Sourcing Equipment (PSE) (e.g., a switch) to supply power to **Powered Devices (PDs)** (e.g., IP phones, cameras, wireless access points) via Ethernet cables.
- The PSE converts AC power into DC power and delivers it to the PDs, allowing them to function without a separate power source.

![[46_qos1_05.png]]

- Excessive electrical current can damage devices. PoE has safeguards to determine if a connected device needs power and how much:
  - The switch (PSE) sends low-power signals to the device (PD) to assess its power requirements.
  - If the PD needs power, the PSE supplies just enough to allow the device to operate.
  - The PSE continues monitoring and adjusting the power delivered to prevent overloading.

#### Power Policing

- **Power policing** helps control how much power a PD can draw:
  - Command: `power inline police`—this enforces default power policing. If a device draws too much power, the port will be disabled, and a **syslog** message is generated.
  - Command: `power inline police action err-disable`—puts the interface in an **error-disabled** state if the PD exceeds its power allowance. The interface must be manually restarted with `shutdown` and `no shutdown` commands.

![[46_qos1_06.png]]

- If you want the port to remain active even if power exceeds the limit, use the command `power inline police action log`. This logs the incident without disabling the interface.

### Introduction to Quality of Service (QoS)

- In earlier times, **voice traffic** (PSTN) and **data traffic** (IP networks) were on separate networks. **QoS** was unnecessary because there was no competition for bandwidth.
- In modern **converged networks**, both voice and data share the same IP infrastructure. While this saves costs and supports advanced features (e.g., Cisco WebEx, MS Teams), it creates competition for bandwidth, leading to potential performance issues.

![[46_qos1_09.png]]

- **Quality of Service (QoS)** is a set of tools that prioritize certain types of network traffic to ensure the best possible performance, particularly for voice and video.

#### Key QoS Metrics

QoS aims to manage the following network traffic characteristics:

- **Bandwidth**:
  - Refers to the capacity of the link (measured in bits per second).
  - QoS can reserve portions of a link’s bandwidth for critical traffic types.
  
- **Delay**:
  - **One-way delay**: Time for traffic to travel from source to destination.
  - **Round-trip delay**: Time for traffic to travel to the destination and back.

- **Jitter**:
  - The variation in delay between packets sent by the same application. IP phones mitigate jitter with **jitter buffers**, providing consistent audio delays.
  
- **Packet Loss**:
  - The percentage of packets that fail to reach their destination. Loss can be caused by network congestion or faulty cables, and devices may discard packets when their packet queues are full.

#### Recommended Standards for Voice Traffic

To ensure good **interactive audio quality**, the following thresholds should be met:

- **One-way delay**: 150 milliseconds or less.
- **Jitter**: 30 milliseconds or less.
- **Packet loss**: 1% or less.

Failure to meet these standards can result in poor call quality, with noticeable delays, echoes, or choppy audio.

### QoS Queuing and Tail Drop

- Network devices often receive traffic faster than they can transmit. Incoming traffic is stored in a **queue**, where it waits its turn to be forwarded.
- By default, queues follow a **First-In, First-Out (FIFO)** policy, meaning packets are transmitted in the order they arrive.
- If the queue fills up, any additional packets are dropped—a condition known as **tail drop**.

![[46_qos1_12.png]]

#### TCP Global Synchronization

- **Tail drop** can lead to **TCP global synchronization**, where multiple TCP hosts simultaneously slow down their transmission rates due to packet loss and then ramp up again, causing network congestion in waves.

![[46_qos1_13.png]]  
![[46_qos1_14.png]]

#### Random Early Detection (RED)

- **RED** helps avoid tail drop by randomly dropping packets before the queue is full, encouraging TCP flows to reduce their transmission rates before congestion becomes severe.
- **Weighted Random Early Detection (WRED)** takes this concept further by applying different thresholds to different types of traffic, ensuring critical traffic (e.g., voice or video) is less likely to be dropped.
