## Corrections to Prior Lectures

### RFC Requirements for IPv6 Address Representation

- **Leading Zeros**: Must be removed.
    - Example: `2001:0db8:0000:0001:0f2a:4fff:fea3:00b1`
    - Becomes: `2001:db8:0:1:f2a:4fff:fea3:b1`

- **Longest Sequence of All-Zero Quartets**: Use `::` to shorten.
    - If there is only one all-zero quartet, do not use `::`.
    - Example: `2001:0000:0000:0000:0f2a:0000:0000:00b1`
    - Becomes: `2001::f2a:0:0:b1`

- **Two Equal-Length Choices for `::`**: Use `::` to shorten the leftmost sequence.
    - Example: `2001:0db8:0000:0000:0f2a:0000:0000:00b1`
    - Becomes: `2001:db8::f2a:0:0:b1`

- **Hexadecimal Characters**: Must be written in lowercase.
    - Use `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, `f` instead of `A`, `B`, `C`, `D`, `E`, `F`.

## IPv6 Header

![IPv6 Header](33_ipv6Part3_01.png)

### Fixed Header Length

- The IPv6 header is always 40 bytes.

### Header Fields

- **Version (4 bits)**:
  - Indicates the IP version used.
  - Fixed value: `6` (0b0110) for IPv6.

- **Traffic Class (8 bits)**:
  - Used for Quality of Service (QoS) to prioritize traffic, such as IP phone calls or live video.

- **Flow Label (20 bits)**:
  - Identifies specific traffic flows between the source and destination.

- **Payload Length (16 bits)**:
  - Specifies the length of the payload (Layer 4 segment) in bytes.
  - The IPv6 header itself is not included in this length, as it is always 40 bytes.

- **Next Header (8 bits)**:
  - Indicates the type of the next header (e.g., TCP or UDP).
  - Equivalent to the IPv4 header's "Protocol" field.

- **Hop Limit (8 bits)**:
  - Decrements by 1 each time a router forwards the packet. If it reaches `0`, the packet is discarded, similar to the TTL field in IPv4.

- **Source Address (128 bits)**:
  - The address of the packet's source.

- **Destination Address (128 bits)**:
  - The address of the packet's destination.

## Solicited-Node Multicast Address

- **Purpose**: An IPv6 solicited-node multicast address is derived from a unicast address.

### Group Addresses for IPv6 Interface

## Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP)

- **Overview**: NDP is used with IPv6 to replace ARP from IPv4. It employs ICMPv6 and solicited-node multicast addresses to discover MAC addresses.

### Message Types

- **Neighbor Solicitation (NS)**:
  - ICMPv6 Type 135.

- **Neighbor Advertisement (NA)**:
  - ICMPv6 Type 136.

![NDP Messages](33_ipv6Part3_04.png)
![Neighbor Discovery Messages](33_ipv6Part3_05.png)

### Neighbor Table

![Neighbor Table](33_ipv6Part3_06.png)

- **Router Discovery**: NDP also enables hosts to discover routers on the local network.

### Router Discovery Messages

- **Router Solicitation (RS)**:
  - ICMPv6 Type 133.
  - Sent to multicast address `FF02::2` (All Routers).
  - Requests routers on the local link to identify themselves when an interface is enabled or a host connects to the network.

- **Router Advertisement (RA)**:
  - ICMPv6 Type 134.
  - Sent to multicast address `FF02::1` (All Nodes).
  - Announcements from routers about their presence and other link information.
  - Sent in response to RS messages and periodically.

## Stateless Address Auto-Configuration (SLAAC)

- **Definition**: SLAAC allows hosts to automatically configure their IPv6 addresses using RS/RA messages.

- **Commands**:
  - Manual prefix entry: `ipv6 address prefix/prefix-length eui-64`.
  - Auto-configured prefix: `ipv6 address autoconfig`, where the device uses NDP to determine the local prefix.

- **Interface ID Generation**: Can be done using EUI-64 or randomly generated, depending on the device.

## Duplicate Address Detection (DAD)

- **Purpose**: DAD ensures that an IPv6 address is unique on the local link.

- **Process**:
  - Performed when an interface is initialized or an IPv6 address is configured.
  - Uses NS and NA messages:
    - The host sends an NS to its own address.
    - If no reply is received, the address is unique.
    - If a reply is received, another device is using the same address.

## IPv6 Static Routing

- **Routing Basics**:
  - IPv6 routing operates similarly to IPv4 but with separate processes and tables.
  - IPv4 routing is enabled by default; IPv6 routing is disabled by default and must be enabled with `ipv6 unicast-routing`.

- **Automatic Routes**:
  - Connected Network Route: Added automatically for each connected network.
  - Local Host Route: Added automatically for each address configured on the router.
  - Link-Local addresses are not included in the routing table.

![Static Routing](33_ipv6Part3_09.png)
![Static Routing Example](33_ipv6Part3_10.png)
![Routing Table](33_ipv6Part3_11.png)

### Static Route Types

- **Directly Attached**:
  - Only the exit interface is specified.
  - Command: `ipv6 route destination/prefix-length exit-interface`.
  - Example: `ipv6 route 2001:db8:0:3::/64 g0/0`.

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ In IPv6, directly attached static routes cannot be used if the interface is Ethernet.
</aside>

- **Recursive**:
  - Only the next-hop address is specified.
  - Command: `ipv6 route destination/prefix-length next-hop`.
  - Example: `ipv6 route 2001:db8:0:3::/64 2001:db8:0:12::2`.

- **Fully Specified**:
  - Both exit interface and next-hop address are specified.
  - Command: `ipv6 route destination/prefix-length exit-interface next-hop`.
  - Example: `ipv6 route 2001:db8:0:3::/64 g0/0 2001:db8:0:12::2`.

### Recursive Routes Example

- **Network Route**:
  - Command: `ipv6 route 2001:db8:0::/64 2001:db8:0:12::2`.
  - Routes to R3/PC2 network via R2's G0/0 interface.

- **Host Route**:
  - Command: `ipv6 route 2001:db8:0:1::100/128 2001:db8:0:12::1`.
  - Command: `ipv6 route 2001:db8:0:3::100/128 2001:db8:0:23::2`.
  - Routes to specific hosts PC1 and PC2 via next-hop addresses of R1 and R3 G0/0 interfaces.

- **Default Route**:
  - Command: `ipv6 route ::/0 2001:db8:0:23::1`.
  - Equivalent to `0.0.0.0/0` in IPv4.

### Floating Static Routes

- **Configuration**: Requires increasing the Administrative Distance (AD) above the current IGP AD value.

### Link-Local Next Hops

![Link-Local Next Hops](33_ipv6Part3_12.png)

- **Note**: When using link-local next hops, specify the interface name, similar to a fully specified static route.
