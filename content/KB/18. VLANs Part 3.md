## Native VLAN on a Router (ROAS)

![[18_vlansPart3_01.png]]

- Native VLAN untagged frames are more **efficient** and **faster** than tagged frames because they are smaller in size.
- Let’s reset both SW1 and SW2 to **native VLAN 10**.

### Configuring Native VLAN on a Router

There are **two methods** to configure the native VLAN on a router:

1. **Using Sub-Interface:**
   - Use the command `encapsulation dot1q <vlan-id>` on the router's sub-interface.

     ![[18_vlansPart3_03.png]]

2. **Using the Physical Interface:**
   - Configure the IP address directly on the router’s physical interface.
   - The `encapsulation dot1q <vlan-id>` command is **not required**.

### Show Running Configuration

- Example output of the `show running-config` command for the G0/0 interface:

## Layer 3 (Multilayer) Switches

![[18_vlansPart3_06.png]]

- A **Multilayer Switch** can perform both switching and routing functions.
- It operates at **Layer 3** of the OSI model (Network Layer), meaning it is capable of routing IP packets.
- You can assign **IP addresses** to Layer 3 virtual interfaces on a Multilayer Switch, similar to a router.
- **SVIs (Switch Virtual Interfaces)** allow you to create virtual interfaces for each VLAN and assign them IP addresses.
- The switch can perform **inter-VLAN routing**, eliminating the need for a router in some network designs.

### Replacing SW2 with a Layer 3 Switch

- The multi-VLAN connections to R1 are replaced with a **point-to-point Layer 3 connection**.

### Using SVIs for Routing

- Configure each host to use the **SVI** (not R1) as the gateway address.
- When hosts need to send traffic to different subnets or VLANs, they send traffic to the switch, which performs the routing.

### Clearing R1's Configuration

- To work with the Layer 3 point-to-point connection, clear the sub-interface configuration on R1:
  - `#no interface <sub-interface id>` — Removes the VLAN interface.
  - `#default interface g0/0` — Resets the G0/0 interface to its default settings.
  - Then configure the **default G0/0 interface** on R1 with the IP address `192.168.1.194` as shown in the network diagram.

### Configuring SW2 for Layer 3 Routing

- Set up **SVIs** on SW2 and establish the Layer 3 point-to-point connection with R1.
- Key commands:
  - `default interface <interface-id>` — Resets the specified interface to its default settings.
  - `ip routing` — **Enables Layer 3 routing** on the switch.
  - `no switchport` — Converts the interface from a Layer 2 switchport to a **Layer 3 routed port**.

  ![[18_vlansPart3_12.png]]

- Configure a **default route** to R1 (`192.168.1.194`) so that all traffic leaving the network gets routed through R1’s **Gateway of Last Resort**.

## SVI Configuration on SW2

### Switch Virtual Interfaces (SVIs)

- SVIs are the **Layer 3 virtual interfaces** on a switch that allow routing between VLANs.
- SVIs are **shut down** by default, so use the `no shutdown` command to enable them.

  ![[18_vlansPart3_15.png]]

### Troubleshooting SVI Status

- If you create an SVI for an unknown VLAN (e.g., VLAN 40), the **status/protocol** will show "down/down".

  ![[18_vlansPart3_16.png]]

To bring an SVI to an "up/up" state, ensure the following:

- The VLAN must exist on the switch.
- At least **one access port** in the VLAN must be in an **up/up** state or a **trunk port** that allows the VLAN must be in an **up/up** state.
- The VLAN itself must not be shutdown (use the `no shutdown` command if needed).
- The SVI must also be **enabled** (`no shutdown`).

### Final Setup: Layer 3 Switch SVI Trunk Replacement

- The VLAN trunk has been successfully replaced by a **Layer 3 Switch SVI**.
- All hosts can now communicate with each other (tested using **ping**) and access the external internet via R1.
