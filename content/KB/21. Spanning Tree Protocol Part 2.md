## STP States

STP uses several states to manage network topology and prevent loops:

![STP States](21_stpPart2_01.png)

1. **Blocking State (Stable)**
   - **Purpose**: Prevent loops by disabling ports.
   - **Characteristics**:
     - **Traffic**: Does not send or receive regular network traffic.
     - **BPDUs**: Does not forward.
     - **MAC Address Learning**: Not performed.
   - **Ports**: Non-designated ports.

2. **Listening State (Transitional)**
   - **Purpose**: Prepare for moving to the Forwarding state.
   - **Characteristics**:
     - **Duration**: 15 seconds (default, controlled by the Forward Delay timer).
     - **Traffic**: Does not send or receive regular network traffic.
     - **BPDUs**: Forwarded and received.
     - **MAC Address Learning**: Not performed.
   - **Ports**: Only designated or root ports enter this state.

3. **Learning State (Transitional)**
   - **Purpose**: Begin learning MAC addresses before forwarding traffic.
   - **Characteristics**:
     - **Duration**: 15 seconds (same Forward Delay timer as Listening state).
     - **Traffic**: Does not send or receive regular network traffic.
     - **BPDUs**: Forwarded and received.
     - **MAC Address Learning**: Performed.
   - **Ports**: Designated or root ports.

4. **Forwarding State (Stable)**
   - **Purpose**: Operate normally.
   - **Characteristics**:
     - **Traffic**: Sends and receives regular network traffic.
     - **BPDUs**: Forwarded and received.
     - **MAC Address Learning**: Performed.
   - **Ports**: Root and designated ports.

## STP Timers

![STP Timers](21_stpPart2_03.png)

- **Hello Timer**: Frequency of BPDU transmission. Default is 2 seconds.
- **Max Age Timer**: Determines how long BPDUs are considered valid before re-evaluating the network topology. Default is 20 seconds.
- **Forward Delay Timer**: Time spent in Listening and Learning states. Default is 15 seconds.

**Key Points:**
- BPDUs are only forwarded out of designated ports.
- A Forwarding port can transition directly to Blocking state.
- A Blocking port must pass through Listening and Learning states before transitioning to Forwarding.

## STP BPDU (Bridge Protocol Data Unit)

![BPDU Header](21_stpPart2_04.png)

- **Regular STP MAC Address**: `01:80:c2:00:00:00`
- **PVST+ MAC Address**: `01:00:0c:cc:cc:cd`

- **PVST**: Uses ISL trunk encapsulation.
- **PVST+**: Supports 802.1Q trunking.

The root bridge's STP timers control all STP timers across the network.

## STP Optional Features

1. **PortFast**
   - **Purpose**: Allows a port to bypass Listening and Learning states and immediately transition to Forwarding.
   - **Usage**: Should be enabled only on ports connected to end hosts to avoid loops.
   - **Command**:
     ```plaintext
     SW1(config)# spanning-tree portfast default
     ```
   - **Effect**: Enables PortFast on all access ports (not trunk ports).

2. **BPDU Guard**
   - **Purpose**: Shuts down a port that receives a BPDU to prevent potential loops.
   - **Command**:
     ```plaintext
     SW1(config)# spanning-tree portfast bpduguard default
     ```
   - **Effect**: Enables BPDU Guard on all PortFast-enabled interfaces.

3. **Root Guard / Loop Guard**
   - These features help prevent topology changes and loops but are less critical for basic CCNA understanding.

## STP Configuration Commands

1. **Set Spanning-Tree Mode**
   - Modern Cisco switches use `rapid-pvst` by default.

2. **Configure the Primary Root Bridge**
   - **Command**:
     ```plaintext
     SW1(config)# spanning-tree vlan <vlan-number> root primary
     ```
   - **Effect**: Sets STP priority to 24576. If another switch with a lower priority exists, this switch’s priority is set to 4096 less than the other switch’s priority.

3. **Configure the Secondary Root Bridge**
   - **Command**:
     ```plaintext
     SW1(config)# spanning-tree vlan <vlan-number> root secondary
     ```
   - **Effect**: Sets STP priority to 28672 (4096 higher than the primary).

4. **Configure STP Port Settings**
   - **Command**:
     ```plaintext
     SW1(config)# interface <interface-id>
     SW1(config-if)# spanning-tree cost <cost-value>
     SW1(config-if)# spanning-tree port-priority <priority-value>
     ```
   - **Effect**:
     - **Cost**: Sets the cost to reach the root bridge.
     - **Port Priority**: Sets the port’s priority in STP decisions.

## VLAN Topologies

- **VLAN 1 Topology**:
  - Originally, SW1 was the primary root bridge.
  - Configured SW3 as the primary root and SW2 as the secondary root.

- **VLAN 2 Topology**:
  - Changes to VLAN 1 do not affect VLAN 2. VLAN 2 maintains the old topology unless reconfigured.

#### STP Port Settings

- **Cost**: Represents the path cost to the root bridge.
- **Port Priority**: Determines the port’s role in STP decision-making.

Understanding these concepts will help you manage STP effectively and ensure a loop-free network environment.
