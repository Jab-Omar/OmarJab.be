## IPv6 Address Configuration (EUI-64)

**Extended Unique Identifier (EUI-64)** is a method used to convert a 48-bit MAC address into a 64-bit interface identifier. This identifier then becomes the "host portion" of a /64 IPv6 address.

### EUI-64 Conversion Example:
1. Given MAC address: `782B CBAC 0867`
2. Split and insert `FF FE`: `782B CBFF FEAC 0867`
3. Invert the 7th bit of the first byte (`8` becomes `A` in hex): `7A2B CBFF FEAC 0867`

Resulting EUI-64 Interface Identifier: `7A2B CBFF FEAC 0867`

## Configuring IPv6 Addresses with EUI-64

When configuring IPv6 addresses using EUI-64, the MAC address undergoes the process outlined above to form the interface identifier. This identifier is then combined with the network prefix to create the full IPv6 address.

- Example: Notice how the "E" in the "2001:DB8..." address changes to "C" due to the 7th bit being flipped (from `1110` to `1100`).

## Why Invert the 7th Bit?

MAC addresses are categorized into two types:

1. **Universally Administered Address (UAA)**: 
   - Uniquely assigned by the manufacturer.
2. **Locally Administered Address (LAA)**: 
   - Manually assigned by an admin or protocol. It doesn't need to be globally unique.

The 7th bit of the MAC address, known as the Universal/Local (U/L) bit, helps identify whether the MAC address is UAA or LAA:
- U/L bit = 0: UAA
- U/L bit = 1: LAA

In IPv6 EUI-64, this meaning is reversed:
- U/L bit = 0: MAC address is an LAA.
- U/L bit = 1: MAC address is a UAA.

## IPv6 Address Types

### 1) Global Unicast Addresses

- Public IPv6 addresses that can be used over the internet. They must be registered and globally unique.
- Initially defined within the 2000::/3 block but now includes all addresses not reserved for other purposes.

### 2) Unique Local Addresses

- Private IPv6 addresses for internal network use. These do not need to be registered or globally unique and cannot be routed over the internet.
- Uses the FC00::/7 block, with the first two digits now required to be `FD` due to an update.

### 3) Link-Local Addresses

- Automatically generated on IPv6-enabled interfaces, using the FE80::/10 block. These addresses are confined to a single link (subnet) and are not routable.
- Commonly used for:
  - Routing protocol peerings (e.g., OSPFv3).
  - Next-hop address for static routes.
  - Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP).

### 4) Multicast Addresses

- Multicast allows a single source to send data to multiple destinations in a group. IPv6 uses FF00::/8 for multicast addresses, and unlike IPv4, IPv6 does not use broadcast addresses.
- You must know the multicast addresses for each router type, as IPv6 and IPv4 addresses share the same last digit.

#### IPv6 Multicast Scope Types:
- **Interface-Local (FF01)**: Packet stays within the local device.
- **Link-Local (FF02)**: Packet remains within the local subnet.
- **Site-Local (FF05)**: Packet can be routed within a single physical location.
- **Organization-Local (FF08)**: Packet can be routed within an entire organization.
- **Global (FF0E)**: Packet can be routed over the internet.

### 5) Anycast Address

- Anycast is a feature where multiple routers are configured with the same IPv6 address. The routing protocol directs packets to the nearest router configured with that address based on the routing metric.
- Anycast addresses do not have a specific range; instead, a regular unicast address is designated as an anycast address.

Example Command: `R1(config-if)# ipv6 address 2000:db8:1:1::99/128 anycast`

### 6) Other IPv6 Addresses

- **:: Address**: The unspecified IPv6 address, used when a device doesn't yet know its own address. IPv6 default routes are configured to `::/0` (equivalent to IPv4's 0.0.0.0).
- **::1 Address**: The loopback address, used to test the protocol stack on the local device (equivalent to IPv4's 127.0.0.1).
