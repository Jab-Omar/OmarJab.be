## Overview of SYSLOG

SYSLOG is an **industry-standard protocol** used for message logging on network devices. It is crucial for monitoring and troubleshooting, allowing you to capture key events happening within a device.

### SYSLOG Use Cases:
- Monitoring changes in **interface status** (e.g., UP/DOWN).
- Tracking changes in **OSPF neighbor status**.
- Logging system restarts and other significant events.
- SYSLOG messages can be:
  - Displayed in the **CLI** (Command-Line Interface).
  - Saved in the **deviceâ€™s RAM**.
  - Sent to an **external SYSLOG server** for centralized logging.

### Key Point:
SYSLOG and SNMP are both used for monitoring and troubleshooting devices but have different functions and methods.

## SYSLOG Message Format

SYSLOG messages follow this structure:

```
seq: time stamp: %facility-severity-MNEMONIC:description
```

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ Note: The `seq` (sequence number) and `time stamp` fields may not always appear, depending on device configuration.
</aside>

### Components of a SYSLOG Message:

- **`seq`**: A sequence number indicating the order of messages.
- **`time stamp`**: Indicates when the message was generated.
- **`facility`**: Identifies which process or component of the device generated the message.
- **`severity`**: A numeric value indicating the severity of the event (from 0 to 7).

    <aside>
    ðŸ’¡ Remember: Memorize the severity levels and keywords for the CCNA exam.

</aside>

- **`MNEMONIC`**: A short code summarizing the event (e.g., LINK_UP, CPU_FAIL).
- **`description`**: Detailed information about the event.

## SYSLOG Logging Locations

SYSLOG messages can be logged in several locations on a device:

- **Console Line**:
  - Messages are displayed in the CLI when connected via the console port.
  - By default, all messages (levels 0-7) are shown.

- **Buffer (RAM)**:
  - Messages are saved in RAM, with all levels (0-7) displayed by default.

- **VTY Lines**:
  - Messages are shown when connected via **Telnet/SSH**.
  - This is disabled by default.

- **External SYSLOG Server**:
  - Messages can be sent to an external server for centralized logging and analysis.
  
  **SYSLOG servers** listen for messages on **UDP Port 514**.

## SYSLOG Configuration

- **Logging Levels**: SYSLOG allows you to set the logging severity level. Messages at the chosen level and more critical (toward level 0) will be displayed.
- Use either the **severity number** or the **keyword** from the severity table when configuring.

---

## Terminal Monitor

By default, even if `logging monitor level` is enabled, SYSLOG messages will **not** be displayed when connected via **Telnet or SSH**. 

To view SYSLOG messages in these sessions, use:

```
R1# terminal monitor
```

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ This command must be re-entered each time you connect via Telnet or SSH.

## Logging Synchronous

When SYSLOG messages appear while typing commands in the CLI, it may cause confusion:

To prevent this, you can enable **logging synchronous** on the specific line, ensuring that the system inserts a new line if typing is interrupted by a message:

![[41_syslog_06.png]]

This results in cleaner output, even if messages arrive while typing commands:

## Service Timestamps and Sequence Numbers

SYSLOG supports **timestamps** and **sequence numbers** to make the log entries more precise and easier to track.

## SYSLOG vs. SNMP

Both SYSLOG and SNMP are used for **monitoring** and **troubleshooting** network devices, but their functionalities differ:

### SYSLOG:
- Focuses on **message logging**.
- Categorizes events based on **facility** and **severity**.
- Used for **system management**, **analysis**, and **troubleshooting**.
- Messages are **pushed** from devices to the server.
  - Unlike SNMP, SYSLOG cannot actively pull data from devices or modify device settings.

### SNMP:
- Used to **retrieve** and **organize** information from devices.
- Can **query** devices for status (e.g., IP addresses, interface status, CPU usage).
- SNMP servers can modify variables on devices using **Set** operations.

In summary:
- **SYSLOG** is about event logging.
- **SNMP** is more dynamic, allowing for both information retrieval and configuration management.
