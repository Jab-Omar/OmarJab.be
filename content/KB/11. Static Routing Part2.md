## Review

- **Switches**: Forward traffic within LANs (Local Area Networks).
- **Routers**: Forward traffic between LANs.

## WAN (Wide Area Network)

A WAN is a network spread over a large geographic area, connecting multiple LANs.

## Static Routes

Static routes are manually configured routes that a router uses to forward traffic to a specific destination. These routes do not change unless manually modified by a network administrator.

## Static Route Configuration

To configure a static route, you specify the destination network, the subnet mask, and the next-hop IP address or exit interface.

- **Basic Syntax**: 
  ```shell
  Router(config)# ip route [destination network] [subnet mask] [next-hop IP/exit interface]
  ```

## Static Route with *Exit-Interface*

When configuring a static route, you can specify the exit interface instead of a next-hop IP address. This tells the router to send packets directly out of the specified interface.

## Default Route

A default route is a catch-all route used by the router when no other specific route matches the destination IP address. It's typically used to direct traffic towards a gateway or the internet.

- **Default Route Syntax**:
  ```shell
  Router(config)# ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 [next-hop IP/exit interface]
  ```
