## What is a Networking Model?

Networking models categorize and provide a structure for networking protocols and standards.  
*(Protocols are a set of logical rules defining how network devices and software should operate.)*

## OSI MODEL

The **Open Systems Interconnection Model (OSI)** is a conceptual framework that standardizes the different functions of a network. Created by the **International Organization for Standardization (ISO)**, the OSI model divides these functions into **7 layers**, which work together to facilitate network communication.

![OSI Model Overview](3_OsiModel&TcpIpSuite_01.png)

### Encapsulation and De-encapsulation

- **Encapsulation**: As data moves from the top layer downward.
- **De-encapsulation**: As data moves from the bottom layer upward.
- **Same-Layer Interaction**: When interactions occur at the same layer.

### Mnemonic for OSI Layers

![OSI Layer Mnemonic](3_OsiModel&TcpIpSuite_03.png)

### The Layers of the OSI Model

#### **7 - APPLICATION**

- Closest layer to the end user.
- Interacts directly with software applications.
- **Protocols**: HTTP, HTTPS

**Functions**:
- Identifying communication partners.
- Synchronizing communication.

---

#### **6 - PRESENTATION**

- Translates data into the appropriate format for transmission (between application and network formats).

---

#### **5 - SESSION**

- Manages dialogues (sessions) between communicating hosts.
- Establishes, manages, and terminates connections between local and remote applications.

*Network engineers usually don‚Äôt work with the top three layers; application developers focus on these layers to connect their applications over networks.*

---

#### **4 - TRANSPORT**

- Segments and reassembles data for communication between end hosts.
- Breaks large data pieces into smaller segments for easier transmission, minimizing transmission errors.
- Provides **HOST-TO-HOST** (end-to-end) communication.

When data from layers 7-5 arrives, it gets a **Layer 4 Header**:

```
<< DATA + L4 Header >>
```

This is called a **SEGMENT**.

---

#### **3 - NETWORK**

- Provides connectivity between end hosts on different networks (e.g., outside of the LAN).
- Supplies logical addressing (IP Addresses).
- Handles path selection between source and destination.

**ROUTERS** operate at Layer 3.

When data and the Layer 4 Header arrive in the Network Layer, it gets a **Layer 3 Header**:

```
<< DATA + L4 Header + L3 Header >>
```

This is called a **PACKET**.

---

#### **2 - DATA LINK**

- Provides **NODE-TO-NODE** connectivity and data transfer (e.g., PC to Switch, Switch to Router).
- Defines how data is formatted for transmission over physical media (e.g., copper UTP cables).
- Detects and possibly corrects physical (Layer 1) errors.
- Uses Layer 2 addressing, separate from Layer 3 addressing.

**SWITCHES** operate at Layer 2.

When the Layer 3 Packet arrives, a **Layer 2 Trailer** and **Header** are added:

```
<< L2 Trailer + DATA + L4 Header + L3 Header + L2 Header >>
```

This is called a **FRAME**.

All steps leading to transmission are called **ENCAPSULATION**. When the frame is sent to the receiver, it undergoes the reverse process called **DE-ENCAPSULATION**, stripping off layers as it moves from OSI Layer 1 to Layer 7.

---

#### **1 - PHYSICAL**

- Defines the physical characteristics of the medium used for data transfer between devices (e.g., voltage levels, maximum transmission distances, physical connectors, cable specifications).
- Converts digital bits into electrical (for wired connections) or radio (for wireless connections) signals.
- All information in **Section 2 (Networking Devices)** relates to the Physical Layer.

### OSI MODEL - Protocol Data Units (PDU)

![PDU in OSI Model](3_OsiModel&TcpIpSuite_04.png)

A **PDU (Protocol Data Unit)** refers to the data format at each layer.

| OSI LAYER # | PDU NAME | PROTOCOL DATA ADDED               |
|-------------|----------|------------------------------------|
| 7-5         | DATA     | Data                               |
| 4           | SEGMENT  | Layer 4 Header Added               |
| 3           | PACKET   | Layer 3 Header Added               |
| 2           | FRAME    | Layer 2 Trailer and Header Added   |
| 1           | BIT      | 0s and 1s Transmission             |

```
<< L2 Trailer + DATA + L4 Header + L3 Header + L2 Header >>
```

### TCP/IP SUITE

The **TCP/IP Suite** is a conceptual model and set of communication protocols used in the Internet and other networks. It is known as TCP/IP due to the foundational protocols in the suite. 

- Developed by the **US Department of Defense** through **DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency)**.
- It has a similar structure to the OSI Model but consists of fewer layers.
- The TCP/IP model is the one actively used in modern networks, while the OSI Model influences how network engineers conceptualize and discuss networks.

### Layer Interactions

![Layer Interactions](3_OsiModel&TcpIpSuite_06.png)

#### **Adjacent-Layer Interactions**

- Interactions between different layers of the OSI Model on the same host.

*Example*: Layers 5-7 sending data to Layer 4, which adds a Layer 4 header (creating a **SEGMENT**).

#### **Same-Layer Interactions**

- Interactions occurring at the same layer on different hosts. 

*Example*: The Application Layer of YouTube's web server and your PC's browser communicate independently of the other layers.
