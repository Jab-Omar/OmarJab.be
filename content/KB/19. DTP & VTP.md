## DTP (Dynamic Trunking Protocol)

- **DTP** allows switches to automatically negotiate their switchport status as either:
  - **Access ports**
  - **Trunk ports**
- DTP is **enabled by default** on all Cisco switch interfaces.

However, we have been manually configuring switchports using:
- `switchport mode access`
- `switchport mode trunk`

üí° You can use `show interfaces <interface-id> switchport` to display the switchport‚Äôs settings.

For **security reasons**, it is recommended to **manually configure** switchports and disable DTP on all ports.

### Dynamic Desirable Mode
- **Actively** tries to form a trunk with other Cisco switches.
- Forms a trunk when connected to another switchport configured as:
  - `switchport mode trunk`
  - `switchport mode dynamic desirable`
  - `switchport mode dynamic auto`
  
If the other switchport is set to **static access**, a trunk will not form, and the port will function as an access port.

### Dynamic Auto Mode
- Does **not** actively attempt to form a trunk.
- Will form a trunk only if the connected switch is actively trying to create one.
- Forms a trunk with a switchport in these modes:
  - `switchport mode trunk`
  - `switchport mode dynamic desirable`

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Trunk to access mode connection results in a **mismatched configuration** and should generate an error. Traffic will not function properly in this case.

### Mode Compatibility Table

The table below shows the compatibility between different modes for forming a trunk:

### DTP with Non-Switch Devices
- **DTP will not form a trunk** with non-switch devices like:
  - Routers
  - PCs
  - Other devices (servers, etc.)
- In these cases, the switchport will default to **access mode**.

### DTP on Old vs. New Switches
- **Old switches**: The default mode was `switchport mode dynamic desirable`.
- **Newer switches**: The default mode is `switchport mode dynamic auto`.

### Disabling DTP Negotiation on an Interface
To prevent DTP negotiation on a switchport, use the following commands:
- `switchport nonegotiate`
- `switchport mode access`

üí° **Security Tip**: It is highly recommended to disable DTP on all switchports and manually configure them as either access or trunk ports.

## Trunk Encapsulation

Cisco switches that support both:
- **802.1Q**
- **ISL** (Inter-Switch Link)

Use DTP to negotiate the trunk encapsulation method.

üí° `switchport trunk encapsulation negotiate`

- **ISL** is preferred over 802.1Q.
  - If both switches support ISL, ISL will be chosen.
- **DTP frames** are sent:
  - In **VLAN1** for ISL encapsulation.
  - In the **native VLAN** for 802.1Q encapsulation (default is VLAN1).

## VTP (VLAN Trunking Protocol)

üí° To view VTP status, use: `#show vtp status` (in Privileged EXEC mode).

- **VTP** is a protocol used to **centralize VLAN configuration** on a server switch.
- Other switches configured as **VTP clients** will synchronize their VLAN databases with the server.
- VTP is **rarely used** and not generally recommended.
- **Three VTP versions** exist:
  1. **VTP v1**: Does not support extended VLAN ranges (1006-4094).
  2. **VTP v2**: Same as v1 but adds support for **Token Ring VLANs**.
  3. **VTP v3**: Supports extended VLAN ranges (1006-4094) and stores the VLAN database in **NVRAM** on client switches.

### VTP Modes

1. **Server Mode**:
   - Can **add, modify, or delete VLANs**.
   - Stores the VLAN database in **NVRAM**.
   - Advertises the latest VLAN database version to client switches over trunk interfaces.
   
2. **Client Mode**:
   - **Cannot** add, modify, or delete VLANs.
   - Synchronizes its VLAN database with the VTP server.
   
3. **Transparent Mode**:
   - Does not participate in the VTP domain or synchronize its VLAN database.
   - Can still add, modify, or delete VLANs locally but won‚Äôt advertise them to other switches.
   - Forwards VTP advertisements between switches in the same domain.

### VTP Servers

- Can add, modify, or delete VLANs and store the database in NVRAM.
- Advertises the **latest version** of the VLAN database to VTP clients.
- VTP servers can also act as **VTP clients**, synchronizing with another server if it has a **higher revision number**.

üö® **Danger**: Connecting an old switch with a higher revision number to the network may cause **all switches** to synchronize with its VLAN database, potentially causing network disruptions.

---

### VTP Clients

üí° To configure a switch as a VTP client, use: `(config)# vtp mode client`

- Cannot add, modify, or delete VLANs.
- **VTP v3 clients** store the VLAN database in **NVRAM**.
- They synchronize with the **server** that has the highest **revision number**.
- Forward VTP advertisements to other switches over trunk ports.

---

### VTP Transparent Mode

üí° To configure a switch in transparent mode, use: `(config)# vtp mode transparent`

- **Does not** synchronize its VLAN database with other switches or participate in the VTP domain.
- Stores its VLAN database locally in NVRAM.
- Can add, modify, or delete VLANs but will not advertise them to other switches.
- Forwards VTP advertisements between other switches in the same domain.

---

### VTP Domains

- If a switch with **no VTP domain** receives a VTP advertisement, it will automatically join that domain.
- If a switch receives a VTP advertisement with a **higher revision number** in the same domain, it will update its VLAN database to match.

---

### Resetting the VTP Revision Number

There are two ways to reset the VTP revision number to **0**:
1. Change the VTP domain to an unused domain.
2. Change the VTP mode to **transparent**.

---

### VTP Version

üí° To change the VTP version, use: `(config)# vtp version <version number>`

- Changing the VTP version forces all connected switches to synchronize with the **latest version**.
