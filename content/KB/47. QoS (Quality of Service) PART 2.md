## Classification and Marking

- The goal of **Quality of Service (QoS)** is to give certain types of network traffic priority over others during periods of congestion.
- **Classification** organizes network traffic (packets) into different **traffic classes (categories)**, a fundamental step in implementing QoS.
    - To apply different treatments to various types of traffic, we first need to **identify** them.
  
### Methods of Classifying Traffic:
- **Access Control Lists (ACLs):** Only traffic that matches the ACL's criteria receives the specified QoS treatment, while other traffic doesn't.
- **NBAR (Network Based Application Recognition):** Performs deep packet inspection up to **Layer 7**, identifying specific traffic types based on application protocols.
- **Layer 2 and Layer 3 Headers:** These contain fields used for classification:
    - **PCP (Priority Code Point)** in the Ethernet header (802.1Q tag).
    - **DSCP (Differentiated Services Code Point)** in the IP header for higher granularity.

### PCP and CoS

![[47_qos2_01.png]]

- **PCP (Priority Code Point)** is also known as **Class of Service (CoS)** and is defined by the **IEEE 802.1p** standard.
    - It consists of 3 bits, allowing for **8 different values** (2Â³ = 8).

![[47_qos2_02.png]]

- **PCP Value 0:**  
    - Indicates **Best Effort** delivery with no guarantees on quality or delivery speed.
  
- **PCP Values 3 and 5:**
    - **PCP 3:** Used for **call signaling traffic** (establishing phone calls).
    - **PCP 5:** Used for the **voice traffic** itself.

- PCP can only be applied in environments where dot1q tags exist, such as:
    - **Trunk Links**.
    - **Access Links** with voice VLANs.

### The IP ToS Byte

![[47_qos2_04.png]]  
![[47_qos2_05.png]]  
- The **Type of Service (ToS)** byte in the IP header includes 6 bits for **DSCP** and 2 bits for **ECN** (Explicit Congestion Notification).

### IP Precedence (Old Method)

![[47_qos2_06.png]]

- Similar to PCP, **IP Precedence (IPP)** uses values from 0 to 7:
    - **6 and 7:** Reserved for **network control traffic** (e.g., OSPF messages between routers).
    - **5:** Voice traffic.
    - **4:** Video traffic.
    - **3:** Voice signaling.
    - **0:** Best effort traffic.

- IP Precedence provides only 6 useful values, which may not be flexible enough for modern networks.

### Differentiated Services Code Point (DSCP)

![[47_qos2_07.png]]

- Defined in **RFC 2474 (1998)**, DSCP allows for more flexibility and standardization in marking different types of traffic.
- **Benefits** of standard DSCP markings:
    - Simplifies **QoS design** and implementation.
    - Facilitates consistent QoS practices between **ISPs and enterprises**.

### Standard DSCP Markings

- **Default Forwarding (DF):** Best effort traffic.
- **Expedited Forwarding (EF):** Low loss, low latency, and low jitter traffic (typically voice).
- **Assured Forwarding (AF):** Provides different classes with varying levels of drop precedence.
- **Class Selector (CS):** Backward compatibility with IP Precedence (IPP).

---

### Default Forwarding (DF)

![[47_qos2_08.png]]

- **Best Effort Traffic** with a DSCP value of 0.

### Expedited Forwarding (EF)

![[47_qos2_09.png]]

- Used for **time-sensitive traffic** such as **voice**, marked with a DSCP value of **46**.

---

### Assured Forwarding (AF)

- **Four traffic classes**, each with **three levels of drop precedence**.
    - Higher drop precedence means a greater likelihood of the packet being dropped during congestion.

![[47_qos2_10.png]]

#### Examples of Assured Forwarding:

![[47_qos2_11.png]]  
![[47_qos2_12.png]]  
![[47_qos2_13.png]]  
![[47_qos2_14.png]]  
![[47_qos2_15.png]]  
![[47_qos2_16.png]]  
![[47_qos2_17.png]]

- **AF41** (highest priority) receives the best treatment.
- **AF13** (lowest priority) receives the worst treatment.

---

### Class Selector (CS)

- Provides **backward compatibility** with IP Precedence using eight DSCP values.

![[47_qos2_18.png]]

---

### RFC 4954

- Developed with Cisco's assistance, RFC 4954 standardizes QoS values across various traffic types.
  
**Key Recommendations:**
- **Voice traffic:** EF.
- **Interactive video:** AF4x.
- **Streaming video:** AF3x.
- **High-priority data:** AF2x.
- **Best effort:** DF.

---

### Trust Boundaries

- **Trust boundaries** define where QoS markings from incoming traffic are trusted.
    - **Trusted markings** are passed along unchanged.
    - **Untrusted markings** are modified according to network policy.

![[47_qos2_19.png]]

- When IP phones connect to a switch, it's recommended to extend the trust boundary to the phone itself, ensuring traffic from PCs does not abuse high-priority markings.

### Queuing and Congestion Management

- When traffic arrives faster than it can be forwarded, packets are stored in a **queue**.
    - If the queue is full, new packets are dropped (**tail drop**).
    - **Random Early Detection (RED)** avoids tail drops by dropping packets early during congestion.

![[47_qos2_21.png]]

- **Multiple queues** are essential for handling different types of traffic, classified based on factors like DSCP markings.

- **Scheduling** determines the order in which packets are forwarded from the queue. A common scheduling method is **Weighted Round-Robin (WRR)**:
    - **Round-robin:** Packets from each queue are forwarded in turn.
    - **Weighted:** Higher priority queues are serviced more frequently.

![[47_qos2_22.png]]

#### Class-Based Weighted Fair Queuing (CBWFQ)

- A popular scheduling method that guarantees each queue a specific percentage of bandwidth during congestion.

![[47_qos2_23.png]]

#### Low Latency Queuing (LLQ)

- **LLQ** designates certain queues as **strict priority**, meaning packets in these queues are always processed first. This minimizes delay and jitter for time-sensitive traffic like voice and video.

![[47_qos2_24.png]]

- **Downside:** LLQ can starve other queues if strict priority queues are constantly full, but this can be mitigated by **policing** traffic rates.

---

### Shaping and Policing

- **Traffic shaping:** Buffers excess traffic when the rate exceeds the configured limit.
- **Traffic policing:** Drops excess traffic or re-marks it when the rate exceeds the limit.

- **Burst traffic** is temporarily allowed over the configured rate to accommodate applications that send data in bursts.
