## Introduction to Port Security

- **Port Security** is a feature available on Cisco switches that helps control which devices can access a network by limiting the MAC addresses allowed on a switchport.
- It ensures that only authorized devices (based on MAC addresses) can send traffic through the switchport.
- If an unauthorized MAC address attempts to access the network, an action will be triggered. The default action is to place the interface in an "err-disabled" state, effectively shutting it down.

- By default, Port Security allows only one MAC address on an interface. 
    - You can either manually specify this allowed MAC address or let the switch dynamically learn the first MAC address to access the interface.
    - Itâ€™s also possible to adjust the maximum number of allowed MAC addresses.
    - A combination of manually specified and dynamically learned MAC addresses can be used.

## Why Use Port Security?

- **Port Security** provides network administrators control over which devices are allowed to connect to the network.
- However, **MAC address spoofing** is relatively easy, meaning attackers can configure devices to use a different MAC address to bypass restrictions.
- Port Security is more useful for limiting the number of devices connected to a port rather than specifying exact MAC addresses.
    - For example, in a **DHCP starvation attack** (as covered in the Day 48 lab), an attacker could flood a switch with fake MAC addresses, filling up the DHCP server's IP pool and the switch's MAC address table.
    - Limiting the number of allowed MAC addresses on an interface protects against such attacks.

## Enabling Port Security

You can check the status of Port Security on an interface with:

`show port-security interface`

## Re-enabling a Disabled Interface

1. **Manual Re-enabling**  
If an interface is disabled due to a security violation, you can manually re-enable it.

2. **Err-disable Recovery**  
Alternatively, you can configure the switch to automatically recover from an "err-disabled" state after a certain time period.

## Violation Modes

Port Security offers three different violation modes that dictate what the switch does when an unauthorized MAC address attempts to access a port:

1. **Shutdown (Default Mode)**
    - The port is placed into an "err-disabled" state, effectively shutting it down.
    - A syslog or SNMP message is generated.
    - The violation counter is set to 1 when the port is disabled.

2. **Restrict**
    - Unauthorized MAC addresses are blocked, but the port remains active.
    - Syslog or SNMP messages are generated for each unauthorized MAC address detected.
    - The violation counter increments for every unauthorized frame.

3. **Protect**
    - Unauthorized MAC addresses are blocked, but no logs or messages are generated, and the violation counter is not incremented.

## Secure MAC Address Aging

![[49_portSecurity_12.png]]

- By default, **secure MAC addresses** do not age out (Aging Time = 0 mins). You can configure the aging time with:  
    `switchport port-security aging time <minutes>`
- Aging Types:
    - **Absolute** (Default):
        - The aging timer starts when the secure MAC address is learned, and the MAC address is removed once the timer expires, even if traffic from that MAC continues.
    - **Inactivity**:
        - The aging timer resets each time a frame from the secure MAC address is received. The MAC address is removed only if no frames are received within the timer period.
    - Configure the aging type with:  
      `switchport port-security aging type {absolute | inactivity}`

- **Secure static MAC addresses** (manually configured) do not age out by default.

## Sticky Secure MAC Addresses

- Enabling **sticky MAC address learning** allows dynamically learned MAC addresses to be added to the running configuration as secure MAC addresses. This is done with:  
    `SW(config-if)# switchport port-security mac-address sticky`
- Sticky MAC addresses do not age out, and to make them permanent, the running configuration must be saved to the startup configuration.
- When the command is issued, all currently learned secure MAC addresses will become sticky.
- To reverse this and convert sticky addresses back to dynamically learned addresses:  
    `no switchport port-security mac-address sticky`

## MAC Address Table

- **Secure MAC addresses** are stored in the MAC address table like any other MAC address.
    - Sticky and manually configured secure MAC addresses are listed as **static**.
    - Dynamically learned secure MAC addresses are listed as **dynamic**.
    - You can view all secure MAC addresses with:  
      `show mac address-table secure`
