## Link State Routing Protocols

![Link State Protocols](26_ospfPart1_00.png)

- **Concept**: In a link-state routing protocol, each router creates a **connectivity map** of the network.
- **Process**: 
  - Routers advertise information about their interfaces (connected networks) to their neighbors.
  - These advertisements are propagated to all routers in the network.
  - Each router uses this shared information to independently calculate the **best routes** to each destination.
- **Resource Usage**: Link-state protocols use more resources (CPU and memory) because more information is shared.
- **Advantage**: Link-state protocols react **faster** to network changes compared to distance-vector protocols.

## Basic OSPF Operations

- **OSPF**: Stands for **Open Shortest Path First**.
- **Algorithm**: Uses the **Shortest Path First (SPF)** algorithm, also known as **Dijkstra‚Äôs Algorithm** (developed by Dutch computer scientist Edsger Dijkstra).
- **Versions**:
  - **OSPFv1 (1989)**: Obsolete.
  - **OSPFv2 (1998)**: Used for IPv4.
  - **OSPFv3 (2008)**: Used for IPv6 (can also be used for IPv4, though OSPFv2 is more common for IPv4).

- **LSAs (Link State Advertisements)**: Routers store network information in LSAs, which are organized in a structure called the **Link State Database (LSDB)**.
- **Flooding LSAs**: Routers flood LSAs throughout the OSPF area until all routers develop the same map of the network (LSDB).

üí° **Note**: LSAs have an aging timer of **30 minutes**. LSAs are re-flooded when the timer expires.

## OSPF: Three Main Steps

1. **Become Neighbors**: Establish neighbor relationships with other routers on the same network segment.
2. **Exchange LSAs**: Share LSAs with neighbor routers.
3. **Calculate Best Routes**: Use the LSDB to calculate the best routes to each destination and insert them into the routing table.

## OSPF Areas

- **Purpose of Areas**: 
  - OSPF uses areas to divide the network and optimize routing efficiency.
  - Small networks can operate as a **single area** without issues.
  - Large networks may suffer performance degradation if configured as a single area, due to:
    - Longer SPF calculation times.
    - Higher CPU usage on routers.
    - Larger LSDBs consuming more memory.
    - Increased LSA flooding and SPF recalculations due to small network changes.
  
- **Solution**: By dividing a large OSPF network into smaller **areas**, you can avoid these issues (similar to how VLANs help manage broadcast domains).

## What is an OSPF Area?

![OSPF Area](26_ospfPart1_02.png)

- **Area**: A set of routers and links that share the same LSDB.
- **Backbone Area (Area 0)**: The central area that all other areas must connect to.
- **Router Types**:
  - **Internal Routers**: Routers with all interfaces in the same area.
  - **Area Border Routers (ABRs)**: Routers with interfaces in multiple areas.
    - **Note**: ABRs maintain a separate LSDB for each area they connect to.
    - **Best Practice**: Connect an ABR to a maximum of two areas to avoid overburdening the router.
  - **Backbone Routers**: Routers connected to the Backbone Area (Area 0).
  
- **Route Types**:
  - **Intra-Area Route**: A route to a destination within the same OSPF area.
  - **Inter-Area Route**: A route to a destination in a different OSPF area.

---

## OSPF Rules

1. **Contiguity**: OSPF areas should be contiguous (no split areas).
2. **Backbone Connection**: All OSPF areas must have at least one ABR connected to the Backbone Area.
3. **Interface Subnet**: OSPF interfaces in the same subnet must be in the same area.

## Basic OSPF Configuration

### OSPF Area 0 Configuration

### OSPF Commands

![OSPF Commands](26_ospfPart1_04.png)

- **Process ID**: The OSPF Process ID is **locally significant**. Routers with different Process IDs can still become OSPF neighbors.
- **Network Command**: The ‚Äúnetwork‚Äù command requires you to specify the area (e.g., "area 0").
- **Single-Area OSPF**: For the CCNA exam, focus on configuring single-area OSPF (Area 0).

### Function of the Network Command

- The "network" command tells OSPF to:
  - Look for any interfaces with an IP address within the specified range.
  - Activate OSPF on those interfaces and assign them to the specified area.
  - Attempt to establish OSPF neighbor relationships with other OSPF-enabled routers.

### Passive Interface Command

![Passive Interface Command](26_ospfPart1_05.png)

- The ‚Äúpassive-interface‚Äù command stops OSPF from sending hello messages out of a specific interface.
- However, the router will continue to advertise the subnet on that interface via LSAs.
- **Best Practice**: Always use the passive-interface command on interfaces that do not have any OSPF neighbors.

### Useful Commands and Outputs

- **Default Settings**: Note the "no" in square brackets; this indicates the default choice.

![Distance (AD) for OSPF](26_ospfPart1_09.png)

- **Administrative Distance**: The default Administrative Distance (AD) for OSPF is **110** but can be changed using the ‚Äúdistance‚Äù command.
