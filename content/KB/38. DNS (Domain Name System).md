## Purpose of DNS

- DNS (Domain Name System) is used to **resolve human-readable domain names** (like `google.com`) into IP addresses.
- Machines (such as PCs) do not use names; they use IP addresses (IPv4 or IPv6).
- Domain names are much easier for humans to use and remember compared to IP addresses.
  - Example: What is the IP address of `youtube.com`?
- When you type `youtube.com` into a web browser, your device queries a **DNS server** for the IP address of `youtube.com`.
- The DNS servers your device uses can be:
  - Manually configured.
  - Learned automatically through **DHCP** (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol).

## Basic Functions of DNS

![[38_dns_01.png]]

### Viewing Local IP Configuration

- Use the `ipconfig /all` command to display the **local IP configuration** of the current device.

### Using nslookup

- The `nslookup` command shows the **IP address** information for a given DNS entry (domain name).

### DNS Packet Capture (Wireshark)

- The results of using commands like `ipconfig` and `nslookup` can be captured and analyzed with Wireshark.

### Managing DNS Cache

- `ipconfig /displaydns` shows the **DNS cache** stored on the device.

- `ipconfig /flushdns` clears the **DNS cache**, forcing the device to fetch fresh DNS information.

### Hosts File

- Devices can use a **hosts file** to map domain names to IP addresses locally, bypassing DNS.
- For Windows, the hosts file is located here:

## Configuring DNS in Cisco IOS

- Devices on a network don’t need DNS to be configured on routers to use DNS:
  - **Routers forward DNS requests** like any other packet.
- However, a **Cisco router** can be configured as a DNS server, although this is not common practice.  
  - Typically, **Windows** or **Linux** servers act as internal DNS servers.
- Cisco routers can also function as **DNS clients**.

### DNS Commands in Cisco IOS

- To configure a Cisco router as a DNS server, use the following commands:
  - `ip dns server` — Enables DNS server functionality on the router.
  - `ip host <hostname> <ip address>` — Manually assigns a hostname to an IP address.

- To view the list of manually configured hostnames, use the `show hosts` command.

- You can also configure **DNS name resolution** using the following commands:
  - `ip name-server <ip>` — Specifies the DNS server(s) the router will use for DNS lookups.
  - `ip domain lookup` — Enables DNS lookup on the router.
