## What is DHCP Snooping?

- **DHCP Snooping** is a security feature found in network switches, used to filter DHCP messages received on untrusted ports. This helps prevent malicious or rogue DHCP servers from distributing IP addresses within the network.
- DHCP Snooping only inspects DHCP messages; non-DHCP traffic is not affected.
- By default, all ports are considered **untrusted**.
    - Typically, **uplink ports** (those connecting to other trusted network devices) are configured as trusted, while **downlink ports** (those connecting to end-user devices) remain untrusted.

## Attacks on DHCP

### DHCP Starvation Attack
- In a **DHCP Starvation Attack**, an attacker floods the network with DHCP Discover messages using spoofed MAC addresses.
- This exhausts the available IP addresses in the DHCP server's pool, leading to a **Denial of Service (DoS)** for legitimate devices trying to obtain an IP address.

### DHCP Poisoning (Man-in-the-Middle Attack)
- Similar to **ARP Poisoning**, a **DHCP Poisoning attack** allows an attacker to set up a rogue DHCP server.
- The rogue server responds to DHCP Discover messages, assigning the client an IP address with the **attacker’s IP as the default gateway**.
- As a result, the client sends all traffic to the attacker, enabling them to intercept or modify the traffic before forwarding it to the legitimate destination.

## DHCP Messages

DHCP Snooping filters messages by identifying whether they originate from DHCP servers or clients:

- **DHCP Server Messages:**
    - **OFFER:** Server offers an IP address to a client.
    - **ACK:** Server acknowledges the client’s request and assigns the IP.
    - **NAK:** The server declines the client’s request for an IP (opposite of ACK).

- **DHCP Client Messages:**
    - **DISCOVER:** Client broadcasts a request to find available DHCP servers.
    - **REQUEST:** Client requests the offered IP address from a server.
    - **RELEASE:** Client informs the server it no longer needs the IP address.
    - **DECLINE:** Client rejects an IP address offered by a server.

## How Does DHCP Snooping Work?

- **Trusted Ports:**  
    - If a DHCP message is received on a **trusted port**, the switch forwards the message without inspection.
  
- **Untrusted Ports:**  
    - If a DHCP message is received on an **untrusted port**, the switch performs additional checks:
        - **DHCP Server Messages** are discarded.
        - **DHCP Client Messages** undergo these verifications:
            - **DISCOVER/REQUEST Messages:**  
              Ensure the source MAC address in the Ethernet frame matches the `CHADDR` field in the DHCP message.
                - **Match:** Forward the message.
                - **Mismatch:** Discard the message.
            - **RELEASE/DECLINE Messages:**  
              Check if the packet's source IP and the receiving interface match the entry in the **DHCP Snooping Binding Table**.
                - **Match:** Forward the message.
                - **Mismatch:** Discard the message.

- When a client successfully leases an IP address, an entry is created in the **DHCP Snooping Binding Table**.

## DHCP Snooping Rate-Limiting

- DHCP Snooping can also limit the rate at which DHCP messages are allowed to enter an interface. This prevents attacks that flood the network with DHCP traffic.
- If the message rate exceeds the configured limit, the interface is placed into an `err-disabled` state, much like in Port Security.
- The interface can be re-enabled manually or configured to recover automatically using `errdisable recovery`.

![[50_dhcpSnooping_09.png]]

- For example, setting the limit rate to **1** would immediately shut down the port because a single DHCP message would trigger the limit, which demonstrates how rate-limiting works.

To automatically recover:

`errdisable recovery cause dhcp-rate-limit`

## DHCP Option 82 (Information Option)

- **Option 82**, also known as the **DHCP Relay Agent Information Option**, is one of many DHCP options. It provides additional information about where a DHCP message was received, including which interface and VLAN it originated from.
- DHCP relay agents add Option 82 to messages forwarded to the remote DHCP server.
- With DHCP Snooping enabled, Cisco switches will add **Option 82** to DHCP messages they receive from clients, even if they aren't acting as a relay agent.
- By default, Cisco switches will drop DHCP messages with Option 82 received on an **untrusted port**.

![[50_dhcpSnooping_11.png]]

In the scenario below, disabling Option 82 on Switch 1 but not Switch 2 leads to traffic being dropped by Router 1 due to **inconsistent relay information**.

![[50_dhcpSnooping_12.png]]

By enabling Option 82 on both switches, DHCP traffic flows correctly, with Router 1 successfully responding to PC1’s DHCP Discover message.
