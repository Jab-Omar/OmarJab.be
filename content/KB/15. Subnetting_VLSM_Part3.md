### Subnetting Class A Networks

**Scenario:**
Given a 10.0.0.0/8 network, you need to create 2000 subnets. 

**Prefix Length Calculation:**
- To determine the prefix length needed for 2000 subnets, calculate the number of bits required:
  - \(2^{10} = 1024\) (not enough)
  - \(2^{11} = 2048\) (sufficient)

  Therefore, you need to borrow 11 bits from the host portion, resulting in a new subnet mask of /19:
  - Original Network: 10.0.0.0/8
  - Subnet Mask: 255.255.224.0
  - New Prefix Length: /19 (8 bits from the original + 11 borrowed bits)

**Hosts per Subnet:**
- Remaining host bits: 32 - 19 = 13 bits
- Number of hosts: \(2^{13} - 2 = 8190\) usable hosts per subnet

### Variable-Length Subnet Masking (VLSM)

**Concept:**
- VLSM allows for subnets of varying sizes, optimizing the use of IP addresses compared to Fixed-Length Subnet Masks (FLSM), where all subnets have the same size.

**Steps for VLSM:**

1. **TOKYO LAN A (110 Hosts):**
   - **Required Subnet Size:** Enough for 128 hosts (\(2^7\))
   - **Subnet Mask:** /25
   - **Network Address:** 192.168.1.0/25
   - **Broadcast Address:** 192.168.1.127
   - **Usable IP Range:** 192.168.1.1 - 192.168.1.126
   - **Total Usable Hosts:** 126 (2^7 - 2)

2. **TORONTO LAN B (45 Hosts):**
   - **Required Subnet Size:** Enough for 64 hosts (\(2^6\))
   - **Subnet Mask:** /26
   - **Network Address:** 192.168.1.128/26
   - **Broadcast Address:** 192.168.1.191
   - **Usable IP Range:** 192.168.1.129 - 192.168.1.190
   - **Total Usable Hosts:** 62 (2^6 - 2)

3. **TORONTO LAN A (29 Hosts):**
   - **Required Subnet Size:** Enough for 32 hosts (\(2^5\))
   - **Subnet Mask:** /27
   - **Network Address:** 192.168.1.192/27
   - **Broadcast Address:** 192.168.1.223
   - **Usable IP Range:** 192.168.1.193 - 192.168.1.222
   - **Total Usable Hosts:** 30 (2^5 - 2)

4. **TOKYO LAN B (8 Hosts):**
   - **Required Subnet Size:** Enough for 16 hosts (\(2^4\))
   - **Subnet Mask:** /28
   - **Network Address:** 192.168.1.224/28
   - **Broadcast Address:** 192.168.1.239
   - **Usable IP Range:** 192.168.1.225 - 192.168.1.238
   - **Total Usable Hosts:** 14 (2^4 - 2)

5. **Point-to-Point Connection (2 Hosts):**
   - **Required Subnet Size:** Enough for 4 hosts (\(2^2\))
   - **Subnet Mask:** /30
   - **Network Address:** 192.168.1.240/30
   - **Broadcast Address:** 192.168.1.243
   - **Usable IP Range:** 192.168.1.241 - 192.168.1.242
   - **Total Usable Hosts:** 2 (2^2 - 2)
