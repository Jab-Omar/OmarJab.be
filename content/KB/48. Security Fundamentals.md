## Key Security Concepts

### Why is Security Important?

The primary goal of **security** in an enterprise is to protect its data, systems, and network from unauthorized access, tampering, and disruption. The core principles of security are embodied in the **CIA Triad**, which forms the foundation of security practices:

- **Confidentiality**:
  - Ensures that only **authorized users** can access specific information.
  - Some data may be public and accessible by anyone, while sensitive or confidential information should only be accessible to specific individuals or groups.

- **Integrity**:
  - Data must remain **unaltered** by unauthorized users, ensuring its accuracy and reliability.
  - The data must be both **correct** and **authentic**.

- **Availability**:
  - Ensures that **networks and systems** are operational and accessible by authorized users when needed.

> Attackers threaten the **confidentiality**, **integrity**, and **availability** of an organizationâ€™s systems and information.

## Vulnerability, Exploit, Threat, and Mitigation

- **Vulnerability**: A potential weakness in a system that could compromise its **CIA** (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability). While a vulnerability is not an issue on its own, it represents a possible entry point for attacks.
  
- **Exploit**: A method or tool that can take advantage of a vulnerability. Simply having an exploit available does not guarantee a problem, but it increases the risk.

- **Threat**: The potential for a vulnerability to be exploited. For instance, a hacker finding and using a vulnerability poses a direct threat to the system.

- **Mitigation**: A strategy or technique used to **protect** against threats. These measures should be applied to all areas where vulnerabilities exist, including:
  - Client devices
  - Servers, switches, routers, and firewalls

ðŸ’¡ **No system is perfectly secure!** Mitigation strategies help minimize risks but cannot eliminate them entirely.

## Common Attack Types

### Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks

- A **DoS attack** threatens the **availability** of a system.
- One common type is the **TCP SYN flood attack**, which exploits the three-way handshake in TCP communications (SYN | SYN-ACK | ACK).
  
  **How it works**:
  - The attacker sends repeated **TCP SYN** messages to the target.
  - The target responds with **SYN-ACK** messages.
  - The attacker never completes the handshake with an **ACK**.
  - As a result, the targetâ€™s connection table fills up, preventing legitimate connections.

- In a **DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service)** attack, multiple computers infected with malware (known as a **botnet**) are used to overwhelm the target system.

### Spoofing Attacks

- **Spoofing** involves using a **fake source address** (IP or MAC) to impersonate another device.
- This technique is commonly used in a variety of attacks. One example is a **DHCP exhaustion** attack, where an attacker uses spoofed MAC addresses to flood the network with **DHCP Discover** messages. This depletes the DHCP serverâ€™s pool of addresses, causing a **Denial of Service** for legitimate users.

### Reflection and Amplification Attacks

- In a **Reflection** attack, the attacker sends traffic to an intermediary system (the **reflector**) but spoofs the **source IP** as the targetâ€™s. The reflector responds, sending traffic to the target.
- An **Amplification** attack occurs when the attacker sends a small request, which triggers a much larger response from the reflector to the target, causing a **DoS**.

### Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks

- In a **Man-in-the-Middle** attack, the attacker secretly intercepts and possibly modifies communications between two parties.
  
  **Example**: **ARP spoofing** (or ARP poisoning)
  - The attacker responds to an **ARP request** pretending to be the intended recipient.
  - This causes the victimâ€™s device to send its traffic to the attacker instead of the legitimate destination.
  
  The attacker can **eavesdrop** on or **alter** the data before forwarding it.

### Reconnaissance Attacks

- **Reconnaissance attacks** are typically **information-gathering** efforts, often using public information to learn about a target. This information is then used to carry out future attacks.
  
  Examples:
  - Running an **nslookup** to find the IP address of a domain.
  - Using a **WHOIS query** to gather details like email addresses or phone numbers.

### Malware

**Malware** refers to harmful software designed to damage or compromise a system. Types of malware include:

- **Viruses**: Infect legitimate software and spread as the software is shared, often corrupting or modifying files.
  
- **Worms**: Standalone malware that spreads without needing a host program. Worms can congest networks, and their payload can harm target devices.
  
- **Trojans**: Disguised as legitimate software, Trojans require user interaction (e.g., opening an email attachment) to execute malicious actions.

> Each malware type can exploit vulnerabilities and impact the **confidentiality**, **integrity**, or **availability** of a target system.

### Social Engineering Attacks

Social engineering attacks exploit human psychology rather than technical weaknesses. They manipulate users into divulging sensitive information or performing actions.

- **Phishing**: Fraudulent emails masquerading as legitimate businesses to steal login credentials.
  - **Spear Phishing**: Targeted phishing aimed at specific individuals.
  - **Whaling**: Phishing attacks on high-profile individuals.
  
- **Vishing**: Voice phishing, where attackers use phone calls to steal information.
  
- **Smishing**: Phishing through SMS messages.
  
- **Watering Hole Attacks**: Compromise trusted websites the victim frequently visits.

- **Tailgating**: Gaining access to secure areas by following someone with legitimate access.

---

### Password-Related Attacks

Systems often rely on **username and password** combinations for authentication, but passwords can be stolen in several ways:

- **Guessing**
- **Dictionary Attacks**: A program tests common words and passwords.
- **Brute Force Attacks**: A program attempts all possible character combinations.

To mitigate this, strong passwords should:
- Be at least **8 characters long**.
- Include **uppercase** and **lowercase letters**.
- Mix **letters and numbers**.
- Incorporate **special characters** (e.g., #, @, !).

## Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

**Multi-Factor Authentication** enhances security by requiring more than just a password for access. It combines two or more of the following factors:

- **Something you know**: A password or PIN.
- **Something you have**: A phone notification, security token, or badge.
- **Something you are**: Biometrics like fingerprint or facial recognition.

MFA greatly reduces the risk of unauthorized access, even if passwords are compromised.

---

## Digital Certificates

**Digital Certificates** are used to verify the identity of a certificate holder. Websites use certificates to prove their authenticity, protecting users from accessing fraudulent sites.

- To obtain a certificate, entities send a **Certificate Signing Request (CSR)** to a **Certificate Authority (CA)**, which then issues the certificate.

## Controlling and Monitoring Users with AAA

**AAA** stands for **Authentication**, **Authorization**, and **Accounting**. It is a framework used to control and monitor access to network resources:

- **Authentication**: Verifying a userâ€™s identity (e.g., logging in).
- **Authorization**: Determining what resources the user is allowed to access.
- **Accounting**: Tracking the user's activity on the system.

Organizations typically use **AAA servers** such as Ciscoâ€™s **Identity Services Engine (ISE)**. Two common AAA protocols are:
- **RADIUS**: An open standard protocol using UDP ports 1812 and 1813.
- **TACACS+**: Cisco proprietary protocol using TCP port 49.

ðŸ’¡ **For the CCNA**, understand the differences between Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting.

## Security Program Elements

- **User Awareness Programs**: Educate employees about potential security risks.
- **User Training Programs**: Provide more formal training to address specific security concerns.
- **Physical Access Controls**: Protect equipment and data by restricting access to secure areas such as **network closets** and **data centers**.
