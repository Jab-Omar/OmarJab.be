## Ethernet Frame Structure

An **Ethernet Frame** is the basic data unit in an Ethernet network. It is composed of three main sections:

- **Ethernet Header**
- **Data Payload** (Packet)
- **Ethernet Trailer**

### Ethernet Header

The Ethernet Header consists of five fields:

1. **Preamble** – 7 bytes
2. **SFD (Start Frame Delimiter)** – 1 byte
3. **Destination Address** – 6 bytes
4. **Source Address** – 6 bytes
5. **Type/Length** – 2 bytes

### Ethernet Trailer

The Ethernet Trailer contains one field:

- **FCS (Frame Check Sequence)** – 4 bytes

**Note**: The **Preamble** and **SFD** are generally not considered part of the Ethernet Header. Therefore, the combined size of the Ethernet Header and Trailer is **18 bytes** (6 + 6 + 2 + 4).

### Minimum Ethernet Frame Size

The minimum size for an Ethernet Frame (Header + Payload + Trailer) is **64 bytes**.

Given that the Ethernet Header and Trailer together occupy **18 bytes**, the minimum size for the Data Payload (Packet) must be:

- **64 bytes - 18 bytes = 46 bytes**

If the Payload is smaller than **46 bytes**, **padding bytes** (a series of zeros) are added to reach the minimum size of 46 bytes.

## Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)

When a PC needs to communicate with a device but does not know its MAC address, it uses an **ARP Request**.

### What is ARP?

- **ARP** stands for **Address Resolution Protocol**.
- It is used to discover the Layer 2 (MAC) address corresponding to a known Layer 3 (IP) address.
- ARP involves two types of messages:
  - **ARP Request** (from the source)
  - **ARP Reply** (from the destination)

### ARP Request

- **Broadcast**: The ARP Request is sent to all devices on the network except the one that sent it.
- Contains:
  - Source IP Address
  - Destination IP Address
  - Source MAC Address
  - **Broadcast MAC Address**: FFFF.FFFF.FFFF

### ARP Reply

- **Unicast**: The ARP Reply is sent only to the device that sent the ARP Request.
- Contains:
  - Source IP Address
  - Destination IP Address
  - Source MAC Address
  - **Destination MAC Address**

## PING Utility

**PING** is a network utility used to test the reachability of a device and measure the round-trip time for messages sent to a destination.

### How PING Works

- It uses two ICMP messages:
  - **ICMP Echo Request**
  - **ICMP Echo Reply**
- PING is a **Unicast** process.
- Command format:
  - `ping <ip-address>`

### PING in Cisco IOS

- By default, a Cisco IOS sends **5 ICMP Echo Requests** and expects 5 Echo Replies.
- Default packet size: **100 bytes**
- PING results:
  - **`.` (period)** – Indicates a failed ping
  - **`!` (exclamation mark)** – Indicates a successful ping

## Useful Cisco IOS Commands

### ARP Table Command

- **Command**: `show arp`
- Displays the ARP table of the device.

### MAC Address Table Commands

- **Command**: `show mac address-table`
  - Displays the MAC address table of the switch, showing:
    - **VLAN**
    - **MAC Address**
    - **Type**
    - **Ports** (interfaces)

### Clearing the MAC Address Table

- **Command**: `clear mac address-table dynamic <optional MAC address>`
  - Clears the entire MAC address table on the switch.
  - If a specific MAC address is provided, only that entry will be cleared.

- **Command**: `clear mac address-table dynamic interface <optional Interface>`
  - Clears MAC table entries for a specific interface on the switch.
