## 📝 Projects

### 📚 Network Knowledge Base

I developed a **Network Knowledge Base** using **Obsidian**, where I organize and document my understanding of key concepts related to network administration and the **CCNA** certification. This personal knowledge base allows me to efficiently take notes in **Markdown** format on various topics such as **OSPF, VLANs, IP addressing**, and troubleshooting techniques.

By consolidating information in this way, I can quickly reference critical networking concepts, making my study process more effective and structured. This project not only enhances my learning but also serves as a valuable resource for others interested in network administration.
