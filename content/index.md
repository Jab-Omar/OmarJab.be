## 📝 Projects

### 📚 Network Knowledge Base

I developed a **Network Knowledge Base** using **Obsidian**, where I organize and document my understanding of key concepts related to network administration and the **CCNA** certification. This personal knowledge base allows me to efficiently take notes in **Markdown** format on various topics such as **OSPF, VLANs, IP addressing**, and troubleshooting techniques.

By consolidating information in this way, I can quickly reference critical networking concepts, making my study process more effective and structured. This project not only enhances my learning but also serves as a valuable resource for others interested in network administration.

### 💻 Multi-VLAN Packet Tracer Lab

I recently completed a **Multi-VLAN** lab in **Packet Tracer**, focusing on configuring **DHCP** across multiple VLANs in two distinct LAN environments. The lab pushed my networking skills to the limit, testing my knowledge in routing protocols like **OSPF** and advanced network services like **NTP**, **Syslog**, and securing management through **SSH**.

This lab showcases my ability to work with complex network setups and troubleshoot real-world issues related to VLANs, DHCP, and routing.
